Only 210/mo of the total 9,520/mo search volume is sports-related. **Before writing, verify that Mr Luck actually offers sports betting in the UK.** If no sports product exists, notify the editor for page removal or redirect to casino review.

## WRITER NOTES & WARNINGS

### 🚨 CRITICAL RESEARCH PRIORITIES:

1. **Verify sports betting product exists:** Mr Luck is casino-focused. Confirm they offer sports betting in UK before writing. If no sports product, notify editor immediately.

2. **Sister sites network:** 150/mo keyword opportunity. Research thoroughly:

5. **Withdrawal times:** Research actual user experiences on Reddit and Trustpilot. Don't rely solely on T&Cs.

**Balanced approach:**
- Pros: Unified account, sister sites network, UK licensed
- Cons: Limited sports markets, smaller operator, casino-focused

**Target audience:** Casual sports bettors, casino crossover users, NOT dedicated sports bettors.

- Payments: 3.5-4.0/5 (UK standard methods)
- Customer Support: 3.5-4.0/5 (verify via testing)
- Overall: 3.5-4.0/5 (casino-first with sports as secondary)

### ⚠️ IF NO SPORTS PRODUCT:

If research confirms Mr Luck does NOT offer sports betting in the UK:
1. **Stop writing immediately**
2. **Notify editor/project manager**
3. **Recommend page actions:**
   - Remove from site structure
