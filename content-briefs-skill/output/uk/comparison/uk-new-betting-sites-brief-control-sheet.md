## Notes & Recommendations

### Writer Guidance
- Emphasize "new" angle throughout (launch dates, recent licenses)
- Use UK terminology (bookmaker, punter, accumulator, each-way)
- Focus on innovation and modern features (not just bonuses)
- Include real user data where possible (App Store ratings, Reddit sentiment)
- Balance new operator benefits with established bookmaker advantages
- Provide license verification instructions for transparency

### Technical Considerations
- Interactive comparison table is HIGH priority (user engagement driver)
- Mobile optimization critical (majority UK traffic is mobile)
- Page speed important (use optimized images, lazy loading)
- Schema markup must pass validation (use Google Rich Results Test)

### Content Refresh Strategy
- Update monthly with new operator launches
- Refresh App Store ratings quarterly
- Update bonus offers monthly (T&Cs change frequently)
- Review Reddit sentiment bi-monthly for emerging operators
- Annual license verification audit (confirm all operators still UKGC licensed)
