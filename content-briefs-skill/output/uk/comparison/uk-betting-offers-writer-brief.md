- You can claim offers from multiple different operators
- **One offer per operator** - can't claim same offer twice
- Example: Claim Bet442 offer, then LuckyMate offer, then NRGbet offer
- **Cannot** claim both desktop and app offer from same operator
- Age and identity verification prevents multi-accounting
- UKGC rules require single account per person per operator
- Recommendation: Prioritize best offers first (see our ranking)
- Space out claims to manage wagering requirements
