## COMPETITOR CONTENT GAPS (OPPORTUNITIES)

### Gaps Identified:
1. **No interactive offer value calculator** - Competitors show offers but don't calculate actual value considering wagering requirements
2. **Limited wagering requirement transparency** - T&Cs buried or not compared side-by-side
3. **No payment method compatibility info** - Which payment methods qualify for deposit bonuses?
4. **Missing mobile app exclusive offers** - App-only promotions not highlighted
5. **No seasonal offer tracking** - Champions League, Grand National offers not tracked
6. **Limited sport-specific recommendations** - Generic offers, not matched to sport preferences
7. **No offer expiry tracking** - Users don't know urgency of claiming
8. **Missing minimum odds comparison** - Key restriction not compared across operators
9. **No existing customer offers** - Focus only on new customers, missing loyalty angle
10. **Limited offer type education** - Users don't understand free bet vs deposit match vs risk-free
11. **No withdrawal speed data** - Great offers are useless if you can't cash out quickly
