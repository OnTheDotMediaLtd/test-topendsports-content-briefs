**Generated:** December 15, 2025

**Template:** Review (Template 1)

---

## ASSIGNMENT

- **Target Keyword:** casina sport
- **Writer:** Lewis Humphries
- **Opportunity:** High
- **Template:** 1 - Review (Single Brand)
- **Market:** Ireland

---

## BRAND CLARIFICATION

**IMPORTANT:** There is a spelling discrepancy:
- **CSV Target Keyword:** "casina sport" (0 searches/mo in Ireland)
- **Actual Brand Name:** "Casinia" (150 searches/mo in Ireland)

**Strategy:** Target the CSV keyword "casina sport" while using the correct brand name "Casinia" throughout the content. The misspelling "casina" likely captures variant searches.
