## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Millioner is an emerging betting brand in the Ireland market, positioned as "Ireland Brand #5" per site structure. This brand review targets users seeking alternatives to the dominant Paddy Power/Boylesports duopoly.

**Key Challenge:** Very low primary keyword volume (10/mo) indicates a new/emerging brand with limited search presence.
