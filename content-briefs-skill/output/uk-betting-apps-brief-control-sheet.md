## STRATEGIC DIRECTION

### Content Gaps to Exploit

| Competitor Gap | Our Solution |
|----------------|--------------|
| Static comparison tables | **Interactive sortable/filterable table with JavaScript** |
| Limited mobile UX analysis | **Dedicated Mobile Experience section per brand (100-150 words)** |
| No calculator integrations | **Link to parlay calculator, odds calculator (unique TopEndSports asset)** |
| Weak payment methods coverage | **Payment methods comparison matrix with icons** |
| Missing app metrics | **Include download size, loading speed, App Store ratings** |
| Limited iOS vs Android analysis | **Dedicated tabbed comparison section** |
| No in-play betting interface reviews | **Include live betting UI/UX ratings per brand** |
| No live streaming availability | **Live streaming availability matrix** |

### Unique Angles
1. **App Performance Metrics** — Download size, loading times, battery usage (data from App Store/Play Store)
2. **Best Odds Guaranteed Focus** — SportsBoom highlights this; create dedicated comparison
3. **Football-Specific Rankings** — UK market is football-dominant; create sport-specific section
4. **Calculator Tool Integration** — Link to existing TopEndSports calculators (parlay, odds, each-way)
