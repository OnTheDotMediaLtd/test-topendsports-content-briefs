## FINAL NOTES FOR WRITER

1. **Mobile Experience is mandatory per brand** - This is a NEW requirement. Dedicate 100-150 words per brand on mobile app/site experience.

2. **GAA and Horse Racing angles are critical** - These are uniquely Irish sports that competitors may miss. Use for differentiation.

3. **Real keyword volumes provided** - These are from Ahrefs API. Use them to prioritize section depth.

4. **T&Cs will be verified in Phase 3** - You can reference T&Cs generally, but AI will add complete verified T&Cs in Phase 3.

5. **Comparison table is interactive** - Just describe the brands in your reviews. AI will build the sortable table in Phase 3.

6. **Calculator tools** - Link to calculator pages; AI will determine if embedding is possible in Phase 3.

7. **This is a high-value page** - Free bets is a high-intent commercial keyword (300/mo primary + 2,340/mo secondary = 2,640 total). Quality is critical.

8. **Ireland ≠ USA** - 18+ not 21+, EUR not USD, GAA not NFL. Keep Ireland context throughout.
