## Notes for Writer (Lewis Humphries)

Hey Lewis,

This is a high-priority, high-competition page targeting 20K/mo for "sports betting apps" plus 102K/mo in secondary keywords. Our main competitor (SportsHandle) is ranking well with 8K word content, so we're going deeper at 9,500 words with 10 brands.

**Key differentiators to emphasize:**
- Technical app details (performance, battery, data usage) - competitors lack this
- Payment method comparison matrix - unique angle
- Current app store ratings - keep these fresh
- State availability matrix - valuable for users
- Mobile UX focus - we're specifically about apps, not sportsbooks in general

**Brand positioning:**
- FanDuel (#1) and BetMGM (#2) are commercial locks - positive but honest
- Bet365 (#3) is critical - 59K/mo branded searches, we MUST rank for "bet365 app"
- theScore BET (#5) - note the ESPN BET rebrand (Dec 2025), newsworthy angle
- All 10 brands need balanced, honest pros/cons

**Technical requirements:**
- Every secondary keyword must appear in an H2, H3, or FAQ
- App Store ratings must be verified within 30 days of writing
- Minimum 10 FAQs targeting specific search queries
- Comprehensive comparison table (Phase 3 will handle interactive version)

Phase 2 Writer Brief coming next with detailed section-by-section outline and keyword mapping. This control sheet is your research foundation.
