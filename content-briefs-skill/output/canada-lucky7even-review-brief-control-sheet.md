## CRITICAL FINDING: SPORTS STATUS UNCLEAR

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Site structure notes "Sports status unclear" for Lucky7even. Keyword research confirms:

- **Casino-focused keywords dominate:** "lucky7even casino" (800/mo), "no deposit bonus" (90/mo multiple variants)
- **No sports betting keywords found:** Zero volume for "lucky7even sports betting", "lucky7even sportsbook", etc.
- **Primary search intent:** Casino gaming, slots, bonuses

**Recommendation:** Writer should:
1. Verify if Lucky7even offers sports betting in Canada
2. If YES: Include sports betting section prominently
3. If NO: Consider repositioning as casino review OR clearly note "casino-focused platform" in intro
4. Contact brand/check website to confirm offerings

### Content Gaps Identified

2. **Unclear casino vs. sports positioning** - no authoritative source clarifies offerings
3. **High bonus search volume not well-served** - users searching for bonus codes/no deposit offers
4. **Mobile app information gap** - 70/mo searches for "lucky7even app" with limited content

### Competitor Brand Reviews (Canada Market)

- Treasure Spins (Critical priority - Brand #1)
- Royalistplay (Critical priority - Brand #2)
- Wyns (High priority - Brand #3)
- Festival Play, Lizaro, Legendplay, Funbet, DirectionBet

**Strategy:** Position as part of comprehensive Canada brand review suite

## WRITER NOTES

**Dear Tom,**

This is a unique assignment with an important research task:

**CRITICAL FIRST STEP:** Verify if Lucky7even offers sports betting in Canada.

- Visit lucky7even.com
- Check if there's a "Sportsbook" or "Sports Betting" section
- If uncertain, contact brand support to confirm

**If SPORTS BETTING exists:**
- Follow standard Template 1 for sportsbook review
- Include casino/slots as secondary offering
- Position as "full-service gaming platform"

**If NO SPORTS BETTING (casino only):**
- Frame as "online casino review" in intro
- Clarify "Lucky7even is primarily an online casino platform"
- Focus content on casino games, slots, live dealer
- Consider whether title should note "casino" explicitly

The keyword data strongly suggests casino focus, but site structure says "sport review" - this needs clarification before writing begins.

**Bonus Section Priority:** Users are highly interested in bonuses (410/mo combined volume). Spend significant words on:
- No deposit bonus details
- Promo code requirements
- Wagering breakdowns
- Real-world examples

**Mobile App:** 70/mo searches - include actual App Store ratings, screenshots if possible, performance notes.

**Canadian Specificity:** Use Canadian spelling (favour, colour, centre), CAD currency, province-specific details throughout.

Questions? Reach out before starting.
