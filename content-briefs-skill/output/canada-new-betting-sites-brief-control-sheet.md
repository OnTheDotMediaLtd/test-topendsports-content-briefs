## STRATEGIC DIRECTION

### Content Gaps to Exploit

Based on competitor analysis, our unique advantages:

1. **Define "New" Criteria** - Competitors don't clearly explain what makes a site "new" (launch date vs. market entry vs. innovation)
2. **Provincial Deep Dive** - Ontario and Quebec specific licensing and availability
3. **Calculator Integration** - Link to bonus value calculator, odds calculator, parlay calculator
4. **New vs Established Comparison** - Direct head-to-head analysis
5. **Risk Assessment Section** - Address trust concerns with new platforms
6. **Innovation Showcase** - Highlight unique tech (AI, crypto, social features)

### Unique Angles vs. Competitors

| Our Angle | Competitor Gap |
|-----------|----------------|
| Launch date timeline visualization | No visual timeline on competitor sites |
| License verification emphasis | Limited trust signals on new sites |
| Innovation categories (AI, crypto, social) | Generic "features" lists |
| Calculator tools integration | No interactive calculators |
| Provincial regulation breakdown | Generic "Canada-wide" approach |
| Risk/reward analysis for new platforms | Only positive features highlighted |
