# UK Writer Briefs - Keyword Cannibalization Audit Report

**Date:** December 15, 2025
**Auditor:** Claude Code
**Scope:** All UK market writer briefs

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Identified and fixed keyword cannibalization across UK writer briefs where the hub page and dedicated pages were competing for the same keywords. The hub page should act as a navigation page linking to dedicated pages, NOT compete with them for their keywords.

**Total Issues Fixed:** 7 cannibalization instances across 3 files
**Files Modified:** 3 writer briefs
**Keyword Volume Recovered:** 4,100/mo properly allocated to correct pages

## CANNIBALIZATION PREVENTION RULES

### ✅ CORRECT: Hub Page Behavior
- Link to all dedicated pages in navigation
- Provide brief overview of each topic
- Include clear "See [Dedicated Page] for full details" links
- Target only general comparison keywords
- Word count: Lower (focused on navigation)

### ❌ WRONG: Hub Page Behavior
- Create comprehensive sections competing with dedicated pages
- Target dedicated page keywords
- Duplicate content from dedicated pages
- Write 500+ word sections on topics with dedicated pages

---

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Use this for future audits:

- [ ] Hub page does NOT target "betting apps", "best betting apps" keywords
- [ ] Hub page does NOT target "betting offers", "sign up offers" keywords
- [ ] Hub page does NOT target "free bets" keywords
- [ ] Hub page does NOT target sport-specific keywords (football, horse racing)
- [ ] Hub page does NOT target "new betting sites" keywords
- [ ] Hub page DOES link to all 6 dedicated UK pages
- [ ] Each dedicated page owns its keyword cluster exclusively
- [ ] No keyword appears in 2+ pages' secondary keyword tables
- [ ] Hub sections are 200-300w with links, not 500+ comprehensive sections

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (COMPLETED):
1. ✅ Remove cannibalized keywords from hub
2. ✅ Reduce/remove duplicate sections
3. ✅ Add internal links to dedicated pages
4. ✅ Update word counts and cluster volumes

### Future Prevention:
1. **Run cannibalization check before generating any new brief**
2. **Use this report as template for other markets** (Ireland, Canada, etc.)
3. **When creating hub pages:**
   - List all dedicated pages first
   - Only target generic market keywords
   - Keep sections brief with clear links
4. **When creating dedicated pages:**
   - Own your keyword cluster completely
   - Don't target hub/other page keywords
   - Cross-link to related dedicated pages (not hub)
