## MARKET CONTEXT

**Challenge:** Wyns is a low-volume, emerging brand in the Canadian sports betting market. Direct brand searches are minimal (150/mo for "wyns casino"), but strategic opportunity exists by positioning Wyns within the broader Canadian sports betting landscape.

**Strategy:** Capture high-volume Canadian sports betting keywords (5,500+/mo combined) while providing comprehensive Wyns review. This positions the page to rank for both brand searches AND category searches.

## STRATEGIC DIRECTION

### Primary Goal
Transform low-volume brand review into high-traffic page by capturing broader Canadian sports betting keywords while maintaining review integrity.

### Content Gaps to Exploit
1. **Legitimacy Questions** — Address "is wyns legit" directly (new brand needs trust signals)
2. **Provincial Context** — Most competitors don't break down provincial age/licensing differences
3. **Comparison Clarity** — Help readers understand where Wyns fits vs established operators
4. **Casino + Sports Coverage** — Wyns offers both; most reviews focus on one or the other

### Unique Angles
- Interactive Canadian province map (age requirements: 19+ vs 18+)
- Detailed regulatory breakdown (iGO vs other provincial bodies)
- Side-by-side comparison table with 5 major Canadian operators
- Calculator tool integration (parlay, odds calculators)
