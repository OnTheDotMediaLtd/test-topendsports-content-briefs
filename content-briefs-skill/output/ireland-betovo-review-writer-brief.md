2. **GAA Betting Coverage** - Irish market relevance (international sites miss this)
3. **Cryptocurrency Payment Guide** - Most reviews mention it but don't explain benefits

Focus extra attention on these sections to differentiate from competitor reviews.

## WRITER NOTES

**Tom,**

Betovo is an emerging Irish bookmaker with some genuinely innovative features (Bet Mentor tool, zero-margin markets, crypto payments) that differentiate it from Paddy Power and Bet365.

**Key points:**
- The Bet Mentor tool is their flagship feature - spend extra time explaining how it works and why bettors would use it
- They use a PWA (Progressive Web App) instead of a native app - explain the pros/cons for Irish users
- GAA betting is critical for Irish market - don't skip this section
- Cryptocurrency payments are a real differentiator (almost instant withdrawals vs 3+ days for cards)

**Tone:** Informative, analytical, but accessible. Betovo is newer than Paddy Power/Bet365, so focus on their unique features rather than trying to claim they're "better" overall. They're a solid alternative with specific strengths.

**Target audience:** Irish bettors (18+) who are comfortable with digital betting and may appreciate innovative features like Bet Mentor and crypto payments.

Let me know if you need clarification on any section!
