## CONTENT GAPS VS COMPETITORS

### What Competitors Lack (Our Opportunities)
1. **Interactive comparison table** with real-time filtering (payment methods, sports, min deposit)

3. **Payment methods deep-dive** (Irish preferences: PayPal, Apple Pay, cards)
4. **Mobile app comparison** with actual App Store ratings
5. **Welcome bonus calculator** tool (interactive)
6. **Horse racing focus** (Ireland has strong racing culture - Cheltenham, Punchestown)
7. **Live betting feature comparison** (in-play popularity growing)
8. **Withdrawal speed comparison** (critical concern for Irish players)
9. **Customer support hours** (Irish timezone availability)
10. **Responsible gambling tools** per operator
