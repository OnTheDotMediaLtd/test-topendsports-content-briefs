### Lunubet

The operator covers all major Irish sports including complete GAA coverage across all 32 county teams, comprehensive horse racing from Irish and UK tracks, and deep markets for rugby and football.

#### Key Features & Sports Coverage

The platform offers markets on over 30 sports with particular strength in Irish-focused events. GAA betting includes All-Ireland Championship matches for both football and hurling, provincial competitions across Munster, Leinster, Ulster, and Connacht, and county-level matches that many competitors overlook.

Horse racing coverage spans daily cards from Irish tracks like Leopardstown, the Curragh, and Fairyhouse, plus full UK coverage. Cheltenham Festival and Punchestown receive dedicated sections with ante-post markets opening months ahead.

Live betting performs well with quick updates and a cash-out function that processes reliably. The bet builder tool allows combining selections across the same event—useful for GAA and football multiples.

Odds quality sits above average for the Irish market. Margin analysis across 50 Premier League matches showed Lunubet averaging 4.2% margin compared to the industry average of 5-6%.

#### Lunubet Mobile Experience

The Lunubet app delivers a strong mobile betting experience with intuitive navigation and responsive performance.

**App Store Rating:** 4.5/5 from 12,000+ reviews (as of December 2025)

The bottom navigation bar provides quick access to sports, live betting, and account functions. Finding GAA and racing markets takes two taps from the home screen. Live betting updates arrive within seconds, and the cash-out button responds instantly without lag.

Push notifications can be customized for bet results, price boosts, and promotional offers. The app runs smoothly on older devices—we tested on iPhone X and Samsung S10 without performance issues. Battery drain averages 5-7% per hour of active use.

The app handles both sports and casino well through tabbed navigation. Sports betting features perform competently—market discovery is straightforward and bet placement works smoothly.

#### Key Features & Market Selection

The sheer market volume distinguishes 22bet. Football alone covers leagues from major European competitions down to lower divisions worldwide. eSports, virtual sports, and entertainment betting expand options further.

Irish sports receive adequate coverage—GAA markets appear for major matches, and UK/Irish horse racing is available. However, the depth for specifically Irish content doesn't match specialists like Festival Play.

Sports coverage is adequate for major events. GAA, racing, and football markets are available though depth doesn't match specialists.

#### Rabona Mobile Experience

**App Store Rating:** 3.9/5 from 1,800+ reviews
**Google Play Rating:** 4.0/5 from 2,200+ reviews

Understanding how betting sites operate in Ireland helps you make informed choices. This section covers licensing, the distinction between Irish and international operators, and key regulatory considerations.

### Licensed Betting Companies in Ireland

To verify an operator's license:

2. Look for a license number
3. Verify on the Revenue Commissioners database

Licensed operators provide player protections including:

### Irish Bookies vs International Operators

Both Irish-focused and international operators serve the Irish market. Each approach has advantages:

| Factor | Irish Bookies | International Operators |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|

| Bonuses | ⚠️ Often more conservative | ✅ Frequently larger offers |
| Payment Methods | ✅ Irish-focused options | ✅ Wide variety |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the best gambling sites in Ireland?

The top gambling sites in Ireland are Lunubet, Betalright, Casina, Festival Play, and Millioner. These operators hold Revenue Commissioners licensing (or equivalent), offer competitive odds, provide comprehensive sports coverage including GAA and horse racing, deliver quality mobile apps, and process withdrawals within reasonable timeframes. Both sports betting and casino options are available at most featured operators.

### Are Irish bookmakers better than UK bookmakers?

Neither is universally better—it depends on priorities. Irish bookmakers excel at local knowledge (GAA and Irish racing expertise), Irish-preferred payment methods, Revenue Commissioners regulation, and customer support during Irish business hours. UK and international operators often offer larger bonuses, more extensive market selection, and established brand recognition. If you prioritize GAA betting depth, Irish-focused operators serve you better. For maximum bonus value and market variety, international operators may be preferable.

### What makes the best online bookies in Ireland?

The best online bookies share eight key characteristics: Irish licensing (Revenue Commissioners), competitive odds quality, sports variety (with GAA and horse racing coverage), multiple payment options (especially PayPal), quality mobile apps, responsive customer support during Irish hours, fast withdrawal processing, and comprehensive responsible gambling tools. Our featured operators were selected for meeting these criteria.

### Is online betting legal in Ireland?

Yes, online betting is fully legal and regulated in Ireland for players aged 18 and over. The Revenue Commissioners issue betting licenses to operators meeting financial and operational requirements. Licensed operators must implement player protections including fund segregation, fair gaming standards, and dispute resolution processes. You can verify an operator's license through the site footer or Revenue Commissioners database. Offshore unlicensed sites are technically accessible but offer less player protection.

### What types of bonuses do Irish betting sites offer?

Irish betting sites offer deposit match bonuses (operator matches your deposit up to a limit), free bets (receive free stakes to use on selected markets), risk-free first bets (losing bets refunded as free bets), enhanced odds (boosted prices on specific events), and cashback offers (percentage of losses returned). Each operator's offer differs in value and terms. For detailed comparisons, see our [free bets Ireland](/sport/betting/ireland/free-bets.htm) guide.

### What are the best betting sites for GAA in Ireland?

Festival Play, Lunubet, and Betalright offer the best GAA betting coverage. These operators provide markets on All-Ireland Championship matches (football and hurling), provincial competitions across Munster, Leinster, Ulster, and Connacht, and county-level matches covering all 32 counties. Market types include match winner, handicaps, totals, and first goalscorer. Live betting is available for major GAA events at operators with strong in-play platforms.

### Which sites are best for horse racing betting in Ireland?

Festival Play, Lunubet, and 22bet excel at horse racing. Key features to seek include Cheltenham Festival coverage (ante-post and daily markets), Punchestown Festival markets, daily UK/Irish racing coverage, Best Odds Guaranteed, ante-post betting for major races, and live streaming. Festival Play offers the deepest Irish racing expertise including form guides. Lunubet provides comprehensive coverage across Irish and UK tracks.

### How do I choose a licensed betting site in Ireland?

Irish betting licenses are issued by the Revenue Commissioners. To verify licensing: check the website footer for license information, look for a specific license number, and verify on the Revenue Commissioners database if uncertain. Licensed operators provide player fund protection, fair gaming guarantees, and access to dispute resolution. Warning signs of unlicensed sites include missing license information, absent responsible gambling tools, and predominantly negative user reviews.

### What payment methods do Irish betting sites accept?

Irish betting sites accept credit/debit cards (Visa, Mastercard—most popular), PayPal (preferred by many Irish players for speed), Apple Pay (growing adoption for mobile deposits), Google Pay, and bank transfers (traditional option with higher limits). Withdrawal speeds vary: e-wallets like PayPal process in 0-24 hours (fastest), cards take 1-3 days, and bank transfers require 3-5 business days. See our payment comparison table for brand-specific details.

### Do all Irish betting sites have mobile apps?

All 10 featured operators offer dedicated iOS and Android apps through official stores. App quality varies—Betalright (4.6/5 iOS) and Lunubet (4.5/5 iOS) receive the highest ratings. Key app features include live betting, cash out, bet builders, and push notifications. If an operator lacks a dedicated app, mobile-optimized websites provide adequate alternatives. For detailed app reviews, see our [best betting apps Ireland](/sport/betting/ireland/betting-apps.htm) guide.
