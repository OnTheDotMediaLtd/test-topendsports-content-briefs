## OPTIMIZED FAQs (10 questions)

### H2: Frequently Asked Questions (500w total)

**Instructions:** Each FAQ answer is 40-60 words. FAQ questions MUST target secondary keywords.

#### 1. What are the best sports betting sites in Canada? ← "best sports betting sites canada" (800/mo)
Answer: FanDuel Canada, BetMGM Canada, and Sports Interaction are the top choices. FanDuel leads in sports selection (40+ sports), BetMGM offers the best welcome bonus ($250+), and Sports Interaction dominates as Canada's most-searched and trusted licensed sportsbook with 25+ years heritage. All three are available in Ontario and most provinces.

#### 2. Is sports betting legal in Canada? ← "legal sports betting canada" (150/mo)
Answer: Yes, if you use a licensed sportsbook. The Criminal Code amendment (2021) legalized provincial sports betting. Licensed operators include iGaming Ontario sportsbooks (FanDuel, BetMGM, Bet365, Betway, DraftKings, etc.). Unlicensed offshore sites remain illegal. Check your province's regulations before betting.

#### 3. Can I bet on NHL and CFL games? ← "nhl betting canada" + "nfl betting canada" (400/mo combined)
Answer: Yes! All 10 featured sportsbooks offer NHL betting. CFL betting is available at 9 of 10 (theScore Bet has strong CFL coverage as Score Media's product). NFL betting is available but less prominent than NHL due to Canadian sports focus. Live betting during games is available at all sites.

#### 4. What payment methods work for Canadian bettors? ← "Canadian" + "payment methods"
Answer: Interac e-Transfer is the preferred Canadian payment method, available at all 10 sportsbooks. InstaDebit, credit/debit cards, PayPal (varies), and e-wallets are also accepted. Withdrawals typically take 1-5 business days depending on method. Interac e-Transfer is fastest (1 hour).

#### 5. How do I deposit with Interac e-Transfer? ← "interac" + "deposit"
Answer: Select "Interac e-Transfer" during deposit (available at all 10 sites). Enter the amount, confirm sportsbook email address, and initiate transfer in your bank app. Fund appears instantly or within 1 hour. Most banks allow $2,000-$10,000 daily limits. Very secure and familiar to Canadian users.

#### 6. What are the age requirements for sports betting in Canada? ← "age" + "sports betting canada"
Answer: Minimum age is 19 years in most provinces (Ontario, BC, Nova Scotia). Alberta, Manitoba, and Quebec allow 18+. Quebec specifically requires 18+. Some provinces may differ. You must verify your age and provide government ID. A strict rule: no one under the legal age in their province can bet.

#### 7. How do I claim welcome bonuses at Canadian sportsbooks? ← "welcome bonus" + "Canada"
Answer: Create an account, verify identity & address, and make your first deposit. The bonus deposits automatically. Read the T&Cs carefully for wagering requirements. Most Canadian sportsbooks have 5-7x wagering requirements. Bonuses are interest-free and must be wagered before withdrawing winnings.

#### 8. Which sportsbook has the best mobile app for iPhone? ← "mobile app" + "iphone" + "sportsbook"
Answer: FanDuel Canada (4.8/5 rating on App Store with 200K+ reviews) and Bet365 (4.7/5) lead in iOS experience. BetMGM (4.7/5) and Betway (4.6/5) are also excellent. Sports Interaction (4.6/5) is simpler but reliable. All are available on the App Store; download free and create an account.

#### 9. Can I get help with problem gambling? ← "problem gambling" + "canada"
Answer: Yes! ConnexOntario (Ontario): 1-866-531-2600 (toll-free, 24/7). All licensed sportsbooks offer self-exclusion, deposit limits, and cooling-off periods. Visit your sportsbook's Responsible Gambling section to set limits. If you're struggling, contact your provincial gambling helpline immediately.

#### 10. What makes Sports Interaction different from other sportsbooks? ← "sports interaction" (46,000/mo!)
Answer: Sports Interaction is Canada's oldest licensed sportsbook, founded in 1997, with 25+ years of trust. It's the most-searched sportsbook in Canada (46K/mo searches).
