## CONTENT GAPS & STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES

### Competitor Weaknesses to Exploit:
1. **Offshore vs Regulated Balance:** Most competitors heavily favor Ontario regulated market. **Our angle:** Better serve non-Ontario players seeking offshore options.
2. **Crypto Payment Depth:** Limited coverage of cryptocurrency options. **Build:** Detailed crypto banking guide for offshore sites.
3. **Mobile UX Analysis:** Shallow app reviews. **Build:** Comprehensive mobile experience section per brand (100-150 words each).
4. **Canadian Banking:** Missing Interac, e-transfer specifics. **Build:** Payment methods comparison section highlighting Canadian options.
5. **Interactive Tools:** No calculators or comparison tools. **Build:** Sortable comparison table, links to parlay/odds calculators.
6. **Provincial Coverage:** Ontario-centric content. **Build:** Province-by-province betting guide beyond Ontario.
7. **Canadian Sports Focus:** Limited CFL, NHL emphasis. **Build:** Canadian sports betting section highlighting local leagues.

### Unique Value Propositions:
- First comprehensive guide balancing licensed (Ontario) vs offshore operators
- Crypto payment guide for Canadian offshore betting
- Mobile-first reviews with detailed UX analysis
- Canadian banking methods comparison (Interac, e-transfer, crypto)
- Provincial regulation breakdown beyond Ontario
