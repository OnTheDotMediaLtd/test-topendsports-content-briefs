All nine sites reviewed hold valid UK Gambling Commission licenses, ensuring safety and regulatory compliance regardless of launch date.

**Keywords:** football betting sites
**Answer (80-100 words):**
Yes, all nine sites hold UK Gambling Commission licenses and are fully legal for UK residents aged 18+. UKGC regulation requires segregated customer funds (your money is protected by law), responsible gambling tools, fair odds, and transparent terms. Check each site's license number (listed in our reviews) on the UKGC register at gamblingcommission.gov.uk. Avoid unlicensed offshore sites, which operate illegally and offer no consumer protection.

---

#### Q6: How do I compare football betting odds?
**Keywords:** football betting odds
**Answer (80-100 words):**
Compare odds in decimal or fractional format across multiple sites before placing bets. Higher odds mean better potential returns for the same stake. Example: A £10 bet at 2.50 (6/4) returns £25 total, while 2.30 (13/10) returns £23 - a £2 difference. Over time, these differences compound significantly. Use our odds converter tool or check multiple sites manually. The sites reviewed here offer competitive football odds, but prices vary by match and market. Maintain accounts at 2-3 sites to consistently find the best available odds. Even 0.1-0.2 decimal differences add up for regular punters.

Withdrawal times vary by payment method and site. E-wallets (PayPal, Skrill, Neteller): typically 24 hours. Debit cards: 2-5 business days. Bank transfers: 3-5 business days. First-time withdrawals may take longer due to mandatory identity verification required by UKGC regulations (usually 24-48 hours).

Weekend withdrawal requests may not be processed until Monday. See each site's individual review for specific withdrawal timelines and limits.
