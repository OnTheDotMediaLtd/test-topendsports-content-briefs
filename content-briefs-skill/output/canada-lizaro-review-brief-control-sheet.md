## NOTES & STRATEGY

### Key Considerations:
1. **Low Search Volume:** Lizaro has minimal direct brand searches (0-20/mo). Strategy focuses on capturing broader Canadian casino/sports betting keywords while providing comprehensive brand information.

2. **Market Context:** This is a smaller Canadian operator, not as established as major brands. Review should be thorough and factual without overselling.

3. **Canadian Specifics:**
   - Provincial licensing varies
   - Payment methods: Interac, e-Transfer (uniquely Canadian)
   - Age requirements differ by province
   - Responsible gambling resources specific to Canada

4. **Content Strategy:**
   - Target high-volume generic keywords (online casino canada, sports betting canada)
   - Provide detailed single-brand review
   - Include comparison context with other Canadian operators
   - Focus on legal status and licensing to build trust

5. **SEO Approach:**
   - Primary goal: Rank for "[brand] + review/sport" brand searches
   - Secondary goal: Capture share of broader Canadian gambling keywords
   - Use natural keyword integration throughout
   - Link to calculator tools for added value
