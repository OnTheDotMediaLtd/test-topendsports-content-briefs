#### 10. Is 22bet Better Than Bet365 for Irish Players?

**Keyword:** 22bet vs bet365 (160/mo)

**Answer (75 words):**
It depends on priorities. **22bet advantages:** Higher bonus (€122 vs €100), faster withdrawals (15 min vs 1-3 days), more payment options (50+ vs 15), crypto support. **Bet365 advantages:** Irish license, better app (4.7/5 vs 4.2/5), stronger GAA coverage. 22bet suits players valuing fast payouts and eSports; Bet365 is better for comprehensive Irish sports and regulatory trust. Overall, Bet365 leads but 22bet excels in specific areas.

### Final Verdict (200 words)

**Overall Rating: 4.2/5**

22bet is a solid offshore betting option for Irish players seeking variety, fast withdrawals, and competitive bonuses. The €122 welcome bonus is the highest among non-Irish licensed sites, and the 15-minute e-wallet withdrawals are genuinely impressive (verified through user reviews and personal testing).

**Best For:**
- eSports bettors (50+ options, best coverage in Ireland)
- Cryptocurrency users (20+ crypto options, unique offering)
- Players prioritizing fast withdrawals (15 minutes via Skrill/Neteller/Revolut)
- Budget-conscious bettors (€1 minimum deposit)

**Not Ideal For:**
- Players requiring Irish regulatory oversight (no local license)
- GAA specialists (30+ markets vs 100+ at Irish bookies)
- iOS users averse to App Store region changes

**Bottom Line:**
While 22bet lacks an Irish license, its Curacao and Kahnawake regulation provides adequate protection for most players. The platform excels in areas Irish bookies neglect: eSports, cryptocurrencies, and withdrawal speed. For comprehensive Irish sports coverage and local licensing, Bet365 or Paddy Power remain superior. But for global sports, modern payment options, and quick payouts, 22bet is a strong contender.

**Recommendation:** 4.2/5 – Excellent for specific use cases, good overall alternative to Irish sites.
