## NOTES FOR LEWIS

**Priority Emphasis:**
1. **App Store ratings are your primary proof points** - Cite FanDuel's 4.9/5 from 1.7M+ reviews prominently. This is the strongest trust signal for mobile users.

2. **Mobile-first focus** - This page is specifically about apps, so emphasize mobile-specific features (interface, speed, touch functionality) over general sportsbook features.

3. **Download instructions are essential** - Many searchers are looking for how to actually get these apps. The iOS and Android sections should be practical and step-by-step.

4. **theScore Bet rebrand** - ESPN BET rebranded to theScore Bet in December 2025. This is important for search accuracy as some users may still search for ESPN BET.

5. **BetMGM's 2-hour payouts** - This is a major mobile differentiator. Highlight prominently since mobile users often want quick access to winnings.

6. **Safety angle** - "Safest betting apps" is a real search concern. Emphasize licensing, regulation, and official app store downloads.

**Target Audience:**
- Mix of first-time app downloaders and experienced mobile bettors
- Many searching from mobile devices (optimize for mobile reading)
- Assume basic smartphone proficiency but explain betting terminology

**Competitive Advantage:**
- Comprehensive app-specific comparison (not just general sportsbook reviews)
- Detailed download instructions for both platforms
- Complete T&Cs for all 7 apps
- Strong TIER 1 source emphasis (App Store data)

Good luck with the content, Lewis. This is a high-volume target keyword with significant mobile search traffic.
