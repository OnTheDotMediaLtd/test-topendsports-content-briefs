## WRITING GUIDELINES

### Tone & Style
- **Authoritative but accessible** for Irish bettors
- **Balanced:** Acknowledge pros AND cons of newer operators
- **Direct:** Get to the point quickly
- **Helpful:** Focus on what players need to know
- **No Hype:** Avoid over-promising or exaggerating features

### Formatting
- **Subheadings:** Use H2/H3 hierarchy (no H4)
- **Lists:** Bulleted for readability
- **Tables:** Use for comparisons, methods, terms
- **Emphasis:** Bold key numbers, USD amounts (actually EUR!), benefits
- **Line Breaks:** Short paragraphs (3-4 lines max per paragraph)

### Terminology
- **"EUR"** (not "€" without context) in first mention
- **"18+"** (not 21+, this is Ireland!)
- **"Accumulator"** standard terminology
- **"Withdrawal"** (not "cashout")
- **"In-play"** (not "live betting" as primary term, though both acceptable)
- **"Responsible gambling"** (consistent terminology)

### Research Notes
- Verify Wonder Luck's licensing jurisdiction (critical!)
- Confirm welcome bonus amount and terms before writing
- Check if app exists and current ratings
- Verify payment methods accepted in Ireland
- Confirm GAA market availability
- Research current promotions at Wonder Luck
