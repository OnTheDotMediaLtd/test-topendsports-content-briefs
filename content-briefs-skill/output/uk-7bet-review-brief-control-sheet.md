- **New Operator Advantage:** Being new means less baggage, modern platform (Altenar), competitive pricing to gain market share.
- **Lithuanian Background:** Positive story — successful in Lithuania since 2020, expanding with confidence to regulated UK market.
- **Bonus Strategy:** UK players choose sports OR casino (not both). Explain this clearly to avoid confusion.
