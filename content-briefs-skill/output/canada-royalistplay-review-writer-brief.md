4. Not available in Ontario or other regulated provinces
5. Dual sports + casino platform for variety
6. For regulated alternatives, see our main Canada guide

**Differentiators from Competitors:**

- Mobile app deep dive
- Provincial availability breakdown
- Payment methods specific to Canada
- Live betting analysis
- User testimonials from Reddit/Trustpilot

4. **Live chat response times** (test if possible)
5. **Cryptocurrency options** (which coins accepted)

8. **Sports coverage depth** (number of markets per sport)
9. **Live streaming availability** (yes/no, which sports)
