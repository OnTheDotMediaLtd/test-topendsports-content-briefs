## STRATEGIC DIRECTION

### Unique Positioning
**Honest Alternative Operator Review**

Unlike major UK operators (Bet365, William Hill, Ladbrokes), Mr Luck is a smaller operator with casino-first heritage. This review should:

1. **Set Realistic Expectations** - Don't oversell. Position as alternative for users seeking different operators
2. **Acknowledge Casino Focus** - 98% of search volume is casino. Address casino + sports crossover
3. **Sister Sites Value** - 150/mo searches for sister sites. This is a unique angle
4. **Trust Building** - Address "is mr luck legit" concerns (60/mo total)
5. **Comparison Context** - Help users understand vs Bet365/William Hill

### Content Gaps to Fill
1. **Sister sites network** - No competitors cover this (150/mo opportunity)
2. **UK payment methods** - Comprehensive UK-specific payment guide
3. **Honest comparison** - Don't position as #1, position as valid alternative
4. **Casino crossover** - Acknowledge what Mr Luck does well (casino)
5. **Trust signals** - UK Gambling Commission, withdrawal times, legitimacy
