1. **This is an HONEST review** - LuckyMate has significant weaknesses (no app, no sports bonus, no horse racing). Address these directly. The target audience values transparency.

2. **0% margin odds is the story** - This is what makes LuckyMate different. Spend time explaining what this means in real pound amounts. Make it concrete.

3. **Mobile app absence is a dealbreaker for many** - Don't bury this. Address it in:
   - Cons list
   - Mobile Experience section (dedicated)
   - FAQs
   - Final verdict

4. **Target audience = serious punters** who:
   - Value odds quality over flashy bonuses
   - Use desktop/laptop (not mobile-first)
   - Care about long-term value
   - Don't need hand-holding

5. **UK-specific context matters:**
   - No horse racing = bigger deal in UK than US
   - GamStop integration = key compliance point
   - 18+ (not 21+)
   - BeGambleAware.org (not US resources)

6. **Citation discipline:**
