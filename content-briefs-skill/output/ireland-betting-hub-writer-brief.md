- Bold for emphasis (sparingly)
- Headers for clear structure
- Tables for comparison data

### Things to Avoid
- ❌ Hype language ("amazing", "incredible", "best ever")
- ❌ Dated references ("in 2025", "this year")
- ❌ Unsupported claims (always cite source)
- ❌ Promotional tone (maintain editorial independence)
- ❌ Generic pros/cons (be specific with evidence)
