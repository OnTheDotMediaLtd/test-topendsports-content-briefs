## STRATEGIC DIRECTION

### Content Gaps to Exploit

1. **Trust verification focus** - Address "is bet442 legit" concerns directly with UK Gambling Commission license check
2. **Dual product review** - Cover both sports betting AND casino (most reviews focus on one)
3. **UK payment landscape** - Explain credit card ban and debit-only options
4. **Competitive context** - Position Bet442 against bet365, William Hill, Ladbrokes for perspective
5. **Mobile-first approach** - Deep-dive app review with real App Store data
6. **Trustpilot integration** - Use real user feedback (3.2/5 rating) for balanced perspective

### Unique Angles

- **Regulatory transparency** - Full UK Gambling Commission compliance breakdown
- **Smaller operator perspective** - Honest assessment vs major bookmakers
- **Payment speed focus** - UK bettors prioritize fast withdrawals
- **App performance testing** - iOS vs Android comparison
- **Casino coverage** - Most betting reviews skip casino product line
