## STRATEGIC DIRECTION

### Content Gaps to Exploit:

1. **Mobile App Testing Methodology** - Competitors list apps but don't explain testing criteria (iOS/Android performance, bet slip speed, live streaming quality)

2. **Payment Methods Comparison** - Missing from all top 3 competitors. UK-specific opportunity: Faster Payments, withdrawal speeds, 2020 credit card ban impact

3. **UKGC Compliance Focus** - Licensing verification, dispute resolution, safer gambling tools comparison per brand

4. **Football-Specific Content** - 200/mo keyword volume untapped. Create Premier League, EFL, European football betting comparison

5. **Interactive Comparison Table** - Sortable by rating, bonus, withdrawal speed, sports coverage (competitors have static lists)

6. **Calculator Integration** - Link to existing TES calculators (odds, accumulator, each-way)

7. **Mobile vs Desktop Experience** - Per-brand analysis missing from competitors

8. **New Bookmaker Guidance** - UK market sees frequent new entrants (Swifty Sports, London.bet mentioned in research) - guide on evaluating new vs established

9. **Withdrawal Speed Transparency** - Competitors mention "fast withdrawals" but don't provide specific timeframes per brand

10. **UK Tax-Free Betting Advantage** - Educational content on Point of Consumption Tax (operator-paid, not consumer)
