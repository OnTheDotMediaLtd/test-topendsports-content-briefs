4. Loading speed and responsiveness
5. In-play betting functionality on mobile
6. Push notifications and alerts
7. Account management on mobile
8. Deposit/withdrawal ease on mobile
9. Customer support accessibility on mobile
10. Special mobile-only features

### Data Sources:
- App Store reviews and ratings
- Google Play Store data

- Official app descriptions
- Personal testing notes

### Example (120 words):
> "BoyleSports' mobile app rates 4.7/5 on the App Store with 187,000 reviews, making it the most downloaded Irish betting app. The interface is optimized for one-handed navigation, with football markets accessible in two taps. Live betting updates display in real-time, and the cash-out feature responds instantly. Push notifications alert users to odds movements on their favorite teams. Account management is straightforward—deposit, withdraw, and check betting history without friction. The app loads quickly on 4G and WiFi, even during major fixtures when server load is heaviest. iOS and Android versions are feature-parity, with both supporting Apple Pay and Google Pay for instant deposits."
