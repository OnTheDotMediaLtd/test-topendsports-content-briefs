**8. How do I read NFL betting odds?**
**Keyword Target:** nfl betting odds (28,000/mo)

NFL betting odds use American format with negative and positive numbers:

**Negative odds (favorites):** -110 means bet $110 to win $100. The number shows how much you must bet to win $100.

**Positive odds (underdogs):** +150 means bet $100 to win $150. The number shows how much you win on a $100 bet.

**Bet types:**
- **Spread:** Team must win by more than the point spread (e.g., Chiefs -7)
- **Moneyline:** Straight-up winner with no spread
- **Totals:** Combined score over or under a number (e.g., Over 47.5)

Standard juice is -110 (bet $110 to win $100). FanDuel offers 29.1% best underdog prices while DraftKings provides 29.9% best underdog prices (highest in the industry).

See the "Understanding NFL Odds" section above for detailed examples and implied probability calculations.

## NOTES FOR LEWIS

**Priority Emphasis:**
1. The "nfl betting odds" keyword (28,000/mo volume) is your highest-traffic term - give the H3 section substantial treatment with clear, authoritative explanations.

2. MUST cite FanDuel's App Store rating (4.9/5 from 1.7M reviews) specifically in the FanDuel section - this is a key trust signal.

3. ESPN BET rebrand to theScore Bet on December 1, 2025 is a major industry change - mention it prominently in the ESPN BET section.

4. The Parlay Calculator link in the parlay section should be prominent and clickable - this is an existing TES asset that adds value.

5. Template 2 requires complete T&Cs for ALL 7 brands - this is non-negotiable. The Complete Bonus T&Cs section must be comprehensive.

6. Line shopping message: Emphasize having accounts at multiple books throughout the content - this is best practice for serious NFL bettors.

7. BetMGM's 2-hour payout speed is a major differentiator - highlight this in multiple places (brand section, payout speed section, FAQ).

8. Keep intro under 150 words - this is a hard limit. Direct answer first sentence is critical.

**Style Notes:**
- Authoritative but accessible tone
- Avoid hype and superlatives unless backed by data
- Use specific numbers and statistics (4.9/5 rating, 29.9% best prices, 40+ props, etc.)
- Every major claim should have a source (App Store, Action Network, Reddit consensus, etc.)
- Balance promotional CTAs with genuinely helpful information

**Target Audience:**
- Mix of experienced bettors and NFL fans new to sports betting
- Assume basic NFL knowledge but explain betting terminology clearly
- Focus on practical value: odds quality, payout speed, specific features

**Competitive Advantage:**
- Your comprehensive keyword coverage (48,900 monthly volume across 16 keywords)
- Superior T&C transparency (all 7 brands completely documented)
- Robust FAQ section (8 questions vs competitors' 3-5)
- Practical tools integration (Parlay Calculator link)
- TIER 1 source emphasis (App Store, Reddit verification)

Good luck with the content, Lewis. This is a critical comparison page with significant traffic potential. Let me know if you have any questions about the brief.
