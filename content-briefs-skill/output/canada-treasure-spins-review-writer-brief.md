## NOTES FOR WRITER

**Lewis,**

This is a **casino review** (not sportsbook) for the **Canadian market**. Key points:

1. **Treasure Spins** has very low branded search volume (30/mo), but we're targeting high-volume generic casino terms (58,630/mo total cluster) to drive traffic.

2. **Canadian Focus is Critical:**
   - Every financial amount must be in CAD
   - Interac e-Transfer is THE most important payment method for Canadians - emphasize this heavily
   - Age requirements vary by province (19+ most, 18+ AB/MB/QC)
   - Use pan-Canadian resources: Responsible Gambling Council and CCSA
   - Customer support hours in EST/PST

3. **Research Required:**
   - You'll need to visit the Treasure Spins official website to verify:
     - Exact bonus amounts and terms
     - Game selection and providers
     - Payment methods and limits
     - License information
     - Customer support channels
   - Cross-reference with Trustpilot/AskGamblers for user experiences

4. **Quality Over Speed:**
   - This is a comprehensive 3,000+ word review
   - Verify every claim with official sources
   - Don't guess at bonus terms or payment limits
   - If information isn't available, state that clearly

5. **Next Steps:**
   - After you complete the writer brief, AI team will create Phase 3 (AI Enhancement)
   - Phase 3 will add HTML comparison tables, schema markup, interactive elements
   - Your content is the foundation - make it solid

If you have questions about Canadian market specifics or need clarification on any section, reach out before starting.
