## STRATEGIC NOTES

**Target Audience:** Canadian sports bettors seeking alternative platform combining sports betting with casino options.

**Pain Points to Address:**
1. "Is Funbet legit?" - Address security and licensing
2. "Where is it available?" - Clarify provincial availability
3. "What sports can I bet?" - Lead with sports coverage
4. "How do I deposit?" - Emphasize Interac e-Transfer convenience

**Competitive Positioning:** Emphasize sports-specific features competitors lack (NHL, CFL, live betting interface).

---

**End of Writer Brief**

Generate comprehensive sports betting content leveraging the Phase 1 research. Tom - emphasize sports betting depth while acknowledging casino offerings. This differentiates Funbet from casino-focused competitors.
