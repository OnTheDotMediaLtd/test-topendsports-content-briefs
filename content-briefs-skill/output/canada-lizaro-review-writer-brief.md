- **Target Keyword:** "lizaro sport"
- **Primary Keyword Volume:** 0/mo (brand-specific, minimal search volume)
- **Total Cluster Volume:** 30,460/mo
- **Word Count Target:** 3,500 words

## STRATEGIC APPROACH

**Challenge:** Lizaro has minimal direct brand search volume (0/mo for "lizaro sport").

**Strategy:** Capture brand-specific searches while ranking for high-volume Canadian casino and sports betting terms. Focus on comprehensive single-brand review covering both casino AND sportsbook (most competitors separate these).

**Key Differentiators:**
1. Combined casino + sports betting coverage in one review
2. Province-specific licensing and availability details
3. Detailed Interac payment method focus (most popular in Canada)
4. Mobile experience emphasis
5. Links to practical calculator tools
