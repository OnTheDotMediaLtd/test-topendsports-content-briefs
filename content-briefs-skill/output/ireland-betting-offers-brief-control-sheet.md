---

## STRATEGIC DIRECTION

### Content Gaps to Exploit

1. **GAA Focus** ⭐ MAJOR GAP
   - Competitors have minimal GAA betting coverage
   - Build 400-word dedicated section
   - Highlight which brands offer GAA price boosts

2. **Newer Irish Brands**
   - Competitors focus on legacy brands only
   - Include Lunubet (rated #1 by many affiliates)
   - Coverage of MGA-licensed operators

3. **Payment Methods Detail**
   - Competitors lack Irish bank integration details
   - Build comparison: Revolut, AIB, Bank of Ireland, N26
   - Withdrawal speed benchmarks

4. **Calculator Integration**
   - Link to odds calculator for offer value comparison
   - Parlay calculator for enhanced odds offers
   - No competitors do this

5. **Deeper Per-Brand Analysis**
   - 600 words per brand vs competitor 200-300
   - More authoritative and comprehensive
   - Better user experience

### Unique Angles vs Competitors

- **Irish Sports First:** GAA, rugby, horse racing prominence
- **More Depth, Fewer Brands:** 10 brands at 600 words each = higher quality than 40 brands at 200 words
- **Mobile-First:** Dedicated mobile experience subsection per brand
- **Source Quality:** Tier 1 sources (App Store, Trustpilot) vs affiliate site copying
