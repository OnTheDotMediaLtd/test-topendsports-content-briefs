## WRITING TIPS

### Be Honest About Mixed Reviews
Bet442 has a 3.2/5 Trustpilot rating. This is below industry average. Be honest:
- Acknowledge the mixed reviews
- Present common complaints fairly
- Present common praise fairly
- Provide balanced verdict

**Example:**
> "Bet442's Trustpilot rating of 3.2/5 reflects mixed user experiences. While some users praise [positive aspect], others report issues with [common complaint]. Our analysis of 50 recent reviews shows..."

### Use Specific Evidence
Don't make vague claims. Use specific data:

❌ "Bet442 has good odds"
✅ "Bet442's Premier League odds average 94.2% payout compared to bet365's 95.1% (Oddschecker data, Dec 2024)"

❌ "Users like the app"
✅ "The Bet442 iOS app rates 4.2/5 with users highlighting 'fast loading times' and 'easy navigation' in 78% of positive reviews"

### Compare Fairly to bet365
bet365 is the UK market leader. Use for context:
- "While bet365 offers 300+ markets per Premier League match, Bet442 provides 120-150 markets"
- "Bet442's welcome bonus (£X) is smaller than bet365's (£Y) but has lower wagering requirements (3x vs 5x)"

### Natural Keyword Usage
Don't force keywords. Use naturally:

❌ "The bet442 app for bet442 betting is a great bet442 mobile app"
✅ "Bet442's mobile app offers convenient betting on the go, with live markets and cash out functionality"
