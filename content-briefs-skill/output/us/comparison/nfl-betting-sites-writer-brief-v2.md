## 📌 CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR WRITER

1. **Header Optimization Map is MANDATORY:** Use the exact optimized headers from Brief Control Sheet. NO generic headers allowed. Every H2/H3 must target a keyword.

2. **theScore BET NOT ESPN BET:** ESPN BET rebranded to theScore BET on December 1, 2025. Use theScore BET throughout. Mention rebrand once for context.

3. **Specific Evidence Required:** Don't say "users love" - say "praised in 847 App Store reviews analyzed October 2025." Every claim needs a number and source.

4. **Line Shopping Emphasis:** Critical theme for NFL bettors. DraftKings 29.9% vs others = real money difference. Recommend multiple accounts.

5. **Word Count Distribution:** 7 brand reviews × 200w = 1,400w. Major sections 400-500w. Don't exceed per-section targets or total will balloon.

6. **Bonus Verification:** You must verify current bonuses from official sites before finalizing. December 3, 2025 verification date is baseline - check for updates.

7. **FanDuel/BetMGM Tracking:** Only these 2 brands have tracking links (✅). Note this for AI Enhancement team.

8. **Competitive Advantage:** We're building interactive tools (sortable tables, features matrix) that competitors don't have. Mention where AI should implement these.

9. **Template 2 Requirements:** Comparison of 7 brands with complete T&Cs for ALL. Not abbreviated. Full legal language needed.

10. **Total Search Volume:** We're targeting 65,850/mo across entire keyword cluster - 8,131% more than primary keywords alone. This is a MAJOR opportunity.
