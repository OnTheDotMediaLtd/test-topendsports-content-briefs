## HUB PAGE STRATEGY - ANTI-CANNIBALIZATION

**THIS IS A HUB PAGE.** It provides an overview and links to dedicated pages. DO NOT compete with dedicated pages for their keywords.

**DEDICATED PAGES (DO NOT CANNIBALIZE):**
- `/[market]/free-bets.htm` - OWNS all "free bets [market]" keywords
- `/[market]/betting-apps.htm` - OWNS all "betting apps [market]" keywords
- Individual review pages - OWN their brand-specific keywords

**HUB PAGE KEYWORDS (SAFE TO TARGET):**
- best betting sites [market], betting sites [market]
- sports betting [market], online betting [market]
- Regulatory, sports-specific, educational content

**LINKS TO DEDICATED PAGES:**
- Must appear prominently in **Introduction (paragraph 2)**
- Must appear in **Quick Answer Box**
- Use clear anchor text: "Best Free Bets [Market]", "Best Betting Apps [Market]"
