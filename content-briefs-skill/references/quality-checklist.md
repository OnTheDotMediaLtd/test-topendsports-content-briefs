## Final Verification

Before completing each phase, ask:

1. **Would this help the writer succeed?**
2. **Are all claims supported by research?**
3. **Is the keyword optimization complete?**
4. **Are compliance requirements met?**
5. **Is the output within word/page limits?**

If any answer is "no" → revise before delivering.
