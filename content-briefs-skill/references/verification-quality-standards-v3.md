## 👥 PART 2: SOURCE HIERARCHY

### Priority Order

**TIER 1: Direct User Feedback (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**
1. **App Store Reviews (iOS)** - Real customers, verified purchases
   - Format: "4.9/5 (1.8M reviews) - analyzed Oct 1-14, 2025"
   - Citation: "Mentioned in 847 App Store reviews as 'best app interface'"

2. **Google Play Reviews (Android)** - Real customers, verified downloads
   - Format: "4.7/5 (371.9K reviews) - analyzed Sept 15-Oct 14"
   - Citation: "Reported in 402 Google Play reviews (Sept-Oct 2025)"

3. **Reddit r/sportsbook** - Unfiltered opinions, no financial incentive
   - Format: "Reddit users report 24-48 hour payouts (15 threads analyzed)"
   - Search: `site:reddit.com/r/sportsbook [brand name]`

4. **Trustpilot** - Verified customer reviews
5. **Better Business Bureau (BBB)** - Official complaint database

**TIER 2: Brand Official Sources (Verification Only)**
- Brand's website: Feature verification only
- Brand's social media: Announcements, issue acknowledgments

**TIER 3: Industry/Regulatory Sources (Facts Only)**
- State Gaming Commissions: Legal status, licenses
- Industry Publications: Market data, revenue figures

**TIER 4: Affiliate Sites (Use Sparingly)**
- ⚠️ Research gaps only
- ❌ NEVER cite for pros/cons or user experience

### Citation Format

✅ **Good Citation:**
```
"FanDuel's mobile app receives consistent praise from users, with 847 App Store
reviewers specifically mentioning 'best app interface' in reviews from the last
30 days (4.9/5 rating across 1.8M total reviews, analyzed Oct 1-14, 2025)."
```

❌ **Bad Citation:**
```
"FanDuel has a great mobile app." (No source)
```

### Source Documentation Format
```
SOURCE: App Store Reviews
TYPE: iOS App Store
DATE ACCESSED: October 14, 2025
DATA POINT: 4.9/5 rating (1.8M reviews)
FINDING: "Best app interface" (847 mentions in last 30 days)
