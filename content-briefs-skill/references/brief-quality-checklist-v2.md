# BRIEF QUALITY CHECKLIST v2.0 (WITH SECONDARY KEYWORDS)

**Use this before delivering Brief Control Sheet in Phase 1**

---

## RESEARCH QUALITY

**Mandatory verifications:**

- [ ] Found URL in Betting Site Structure CSV (not assumed)
- [ ] Extracted ACTUAL target keyword from structure (not from URL)
- [ ] Identified affiliate competitors (review sites, NOT brand landing pages)
- [ ] Called `Ahrefs:doc` before each Ahrefs function

**Secondary keyword research (NEW):**

- [ ] Identified 8-15 secondary keywords
- [ ] Each keyword has search volume data
- [ ] Each keyword mapped to specific section (H2/H3/FAQ)
- [ ] Total search volume calculated
- [ ] % increase over primary alone calculated
- [ ] High-volume keywords (200+/mo) prioritized for H2 titles
- [ ] Question keywords mapped to FAQs
- [ ] Comparison keywords included ("[brand] vs [competitor]")
- [ ] Feature keywords included ("[brand] bonus", "[brand] app")

**Competitor analysis:**

- [ ] Checked top 3 affiliate competitors

- [ ] Identified gaps or weaknesses in competitor content
- [ ] Checked approximate competitor word counts (if using web_fetch)

**Brand selection (if applicable):**

## STRATEGIC DIRECTION

**Content focus:**

- [ ] Strategic direction matches what competitors emphasize PLUS gaps they miss
- [ ] If ALL 3 competitors cover topic extensively → noted in strategic direction
- [ ] Unique angle identified (what we'll do differently)
- [ ] Word count target set based on competitor landscape (not arbitrary)

**Keyword optimization strategy (NEW):**

- [ ] High-volume secondary keywords assigned to main H2 sections
- [ ] Medium-volume keywords assigned to H3 subsections
- [ ] Question keywords assigned to specific FAQ questions
- [ ] Natural placement strategy defined for lower-volume keywords

**Gap mapping:**

- [ ] Competitor gaps mapped to technical requirements for Phase 3
- [ ] Example: "No calculator" → "Build interactive calculator"
- [ ] Example: "Static table" → "Build sortable/filterable table"
- [ ] Example: "3 FAQs" → "Build 7 FAQs with schema"

## OUTPUT QUALITY

**Brief Control Sheet format:**

- [ ] Under 700 words total (increased from 600 for keyword mapping)

   - [ ] No - skipped or incomplete

4. Is my Brief Control Sheet focused on decisions?
   - [ ] Yes - actionable, under 700 words
   - [ ] No - too much documentation/research detail

5. Did I map competitor gaps to build requirements?
   - [ ] Yes - clear feature requirements for Phase 3
   - [ ] No - just noted gaps without actionable items

**If any answer is "No" → Review and revise before delivering.**

## QUICK TIPS

**If brief feels generic:**
→ You probably didn't analyze competitors deeply enough. Check what they emphasize.

**If missing secondary keywords:**
→ Use keywords-explorer-related-terms or web research. Focus on comparisons, features, questions.

**If word count seems random:**
→ Check competitor lengths. Calculate average. Target average + 10%.

**If missing obvious features:**
→ Create mental matrix: What do 3/3 competitors have that subject lacks?

**If brief is over 700 words:**
→ Too much documentation. Focus on decisions only. Remove research detail. Move keyword details to table format.

**If unsure about keyword mapping:**
→ High volume (200+) = H2
→ Medium (100-200) = H3
→ Questions = FAQ
→ Low volume = natural mentions
