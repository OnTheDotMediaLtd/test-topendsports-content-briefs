## KEYWORD VOLUME THRESHOLDS

**How to prioritize secondary keywords:**

| Search Volume | Placement | Priority |
|---------------|-----------|----------|
| 500+ /mo | H2 section title | HIGHEST |
| 200-500 /mo | H2 or prominent H3 | HIGH |
| 100-200 /mo | H3 subsection | MEDIUM |
| 50-100 /mo | FAQ or natural mentions | LOW |
| <50 /mo | Natural mentions only | OPTIONAL |

**Note:** Adjust thresholds based on total opportunity. For low-volume niches, even 50/mo keywords may warrant H3 sections.
