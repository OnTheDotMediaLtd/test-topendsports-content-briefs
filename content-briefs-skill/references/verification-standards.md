## Overview

This document establishes quality assurance protocols for content verification before publishing. All TopEndSports content briefs must pass verification standards in these seven key areas.

---

## Keyword Research Verification

### 5-Step Protocol

#### Step 1: Volume Validation

**What to Check:**
- Primary keyword search volume is accurate
- Volume data is recent (within last 30 days)
- Volume range is specified (e.g., "2,400 monthly searches")
- Volume source is reliable (Ahrefs, SEMrush, or similar tool)

**Validation Process:**
1. Open keyword research tool (Ahrefs recommended)
2. Search for exact primary keyword
3. Record volume for target country (typically USA)
4. Check "Year-on-Year" trend to confirm stability
5. Compare against 2-3 month trend - reject if declining >15%

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Volume data must be 2400+ monthly searches for high-volume content
- Volume must be stable or growing (not declining trend)
- Data must be from professional SEO tool
- Document volume in article intro or metadata

**Failure Points:**
- Volume data missing or undocumented
- Volume <2,000 monthly (unless long-tail focused piece)
- Volume declining significantly (>15% month-over-month)
- Data from non-professional source (search bar suggestions, etc.)

**Example Documentation:**
```
Primary Keyword: "best sportsbooks"
Monthly Volume: 2,400 searches (USA)
Tool: Ahrefs
Last Checked: December 2024
Trend: Stable (no significant monthly change)
Status: PASS
```

#### Step 2: Relevance Check

**What to Check:**
- Keyword matches article content exactly
- Content addresses user search intent
- Header structure reflects keyword naturally
- No keyword stuffing or forced placement

**Validation Process:**
1. Read article intro (first 100 words)
2. Scan all H2 headers for keyword presence
3. Check first H2 header contains or closely matches keyword
4. Verify content answers search intent
5. Test readability - remove keyword, does content still make sense?

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Primary keyword appears in first H2 header
- Keyword appears naturally in intro paragraph
- Content fully addresses what searcher is looking for
- No forced or unnatural keyword placement

**Failure Points:**
- Keyword not in any H2 header
- Content doesn't match search intent (e.g., "best sportsbooks" article about sports history)
- Keyword appears awkwardly or repeatedly (>2% density)
- Reader confusion if keyword removed

**Intent Matching Examples:**

| Keyword | User Intent | Required Content Elements |
|---------|-----------|--------------------------|
| "best sportsbooks" | Find top-ranked platforms | Comparison table, pros/cons, rankings |
| "how to sign up FanDuel" | Step-by-step process | Numbered steps, screenshots |
| "FanDuel review" | Evaluate specific brand | Bonus details, T&Cs, mobile experience |
| "Pennsylvania sportsbooks" | Find legal operators in state | Available operators, state laws, bonuses |

#### Step 3: Competition Analysis

**What to Check:**
- Top-ranking competitors have been analyzed
- Our content distinguishes from competitors
- Opportunity exists to rank for this keyword
- Difficulty level is reasonable

**Validation Process:**
1. Search keyword in Google (incognito mode)
2. Analyze top 5 results for content length
3. Identify what they cover vs. what we cover
4. Check if our angle is unique/better
5. Verify keyword difficulty level <70 (moderate)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Competitor analysis completed before writing
- Our content length meets/exceeds #1 result (±10%)
- Unique angle or superior information identified
- Keyword difficulty <70 (medium difficulty acceptable)
- At least 3 competitor articles analyzed

**Failure Points:**
- No competitor analysis documented
- Our word count significantly lower than competitors
- Content is generic/same as top results
- Keyword difficulty >80 (too competitive)

**Competition Analysis Template:**
```
Keyword: "best sportsbooks"

Top Ranking Competitors:
1. Forbes (4,200 words) - Comparison table, 8 brands
2. Sports Illustrated (3,800 words) - Reviews, bonus breakdown
3. Gambling.com (5,100 words) - Detailed reviews, state pages
4. The Athletic (3,400 words) - Expert opinion, ratings

Our Approach:
- Word Count: 4,500 (meets top result)
- Unique Angle: Mobile-first review, latest 2025 bonuses
- Added Value: Comparison calculator, live odds integration
- Differentiation: State-specific operator filters

Status: PASS - Can compete for ranking
```

#### Step 4: Intent Matching

**What to Check:**
- Search intent is identified (informational, commercial, transactional, navigational)
- Content structure matches intent
- CTA (call-to-action) aligns with intent type
- User journey is satisfied

**Validation Process:**
1. Identify search intent type (see table below)
2. Verify content structure matches intent
3. Check CTA appropriateness for intent
4. Ensure user questions are answered

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Search intent clearly identified
- Content structure matches intent type
- CTA is appropriate for user goal
- No misalignment between keyword and content

**Failure Points:**
- Intent not identified
- Content structure doesn't match intent
- CTA pushes wrong action for intent
- User confusion about content purpose

**Intent Type Matching:**

| Intent Type | Example Keywords | Required Content | Ideal CTA |
|------------|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Informational | "how to sign up sportsbook" | Step-by-step guide, screenshots | Visit platform, start trial |
| Commercial | "best sportsbooks 2025" | Comparison, pros/cons, rankings | Choose sportsbook, sign up |
| Transactional | "FanDuel sign up" | Direct sign-up link, quick steps | Sign up now |
| Navigational | "FanDuel" | Brand info, official features | Visit official site |

#### Step 5: Cluster Building

**What to Check:**
- Secondary keywords identified (8-15 minimum)
- Each secondary has volume data
- Total cluster volume is 400-900% above primary
- Keywords are mapped to sections

**Validation Process:**
1. List all secondary keywords with volume
2. Calculate cluster total volume
3. Determine percentage increase: (Total - Primary) / Primary × 100
4. Verify 400-900% target
5. Check keyword mapping to H2/H3 headers

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 8-15 secondary keywords identified
- Each keyword has documented volume
- Cluster volume increase: 400-900%
- Every secondary keyword mapped to content section
- No keyword cannibalization within cluster

**Failure Points:**
- Fewer than 8 secondary keywords
- Secondary keywords lack volume data
- Cluster volume increase <300% or >1000%
- Keywords not mapped to any section
- Multiple keywords competing for same header

**Cluster Building Example:**
```
Primary Keyword: "best sportsbooks" (2,400/month)

Secondary Keywords:
1. sportsbook apps (1,100)
2. betting apps (950)
3. online sportsbooks (850)
4. mobile betting apps (720)
5. sports betting sites (680)
6. legal sportsbooks (620)
7. top sportsbooks (580)
8. sports betting platforms (450)
9. best betting sites (420)
10. online sports betting (380)
11. mobile sportsbook (310)
12. legal sports betting (290)
13. sportsbook bonuses (270)
14. best odds sportsbooks (240)
15. live betting sportsbooks (230)

Cluster Total: 8,070 /month
Increase: (8,070 - 2,400) / 2,400 = 236%
Status: Below 400% target - FAIL
Add 8-10 more keywords to reach 400%+
```

## Source Tier Hierarchy

### Tier 1: Primary Sources (Highest Authority)

**What Qualifies:**
- Original data/research
- Direct testing by brand
- First-hand user experience
- Official brand sources with disclaimers

**Acceptable Examples:**
- App Store reviews (real user feedback)
- Reddit threads (peer discussion, multiple perspectives)
- BBB (Better Business Bureau) ratings
- Direct brand customer service conversations
- Published academic research on sports betting

**How to Use:**
- Quote or cite directly with attribution
- Include source link
- Maintain context (don't misrepresent)
- Note date of source if time-sensitive

**Verification Steps:**
- [ ] Source is original/primary (not summarized elsewhere)
- [ ] Data is recent (within 6 months for user reviews)
- [ ] Multiple sources confirm finding (don't rely on single review)
- [ ] Source author is credible/verifiable

### Tier 2: Secondary Sources (Good Authority)

**What Qualifies:**
- Industry news sites (ESPN, Sports Illustrated)
- Established gambling/sports journalism outlets
- Government regulatory information (state gaming boards)
- Published analyst reports

**Acceptable Examples:**
- ESPN article about DraftKings partnership
- State gaming commission official regulations
- Published analyst report on sports betting market
- Industry publication article

**How to Use:**
- Reference but don't heavily rely on
- Verify information against Tier 1 sources
- Use for market context/industry trends
- Cite source with URL

**Verification Steps:**
- [ ] Source is from established publication
- [ ] Author/publication has relevant expertise
- [ ] Information is current and not outdated
- [ ] Claims can be cross-verified with other sources

### Tier 3: Tertiary Sources (Moderate Authority)

**What Qualifies:**
- Other affiliate sportsbook review sites
- General business publications
- Educational content about sports betting
- Market research summaries

**Acceptable Examples:**
- Other sportsbook review website's findings
- Forbes article about sportsbook industry
- Gambling education website explanation
- Industry market research summary

**How to Use:**
- Use sparingly and only for context
- Cross-verify with Tier 1 sources
- Acknowledge other sources in comparison
- Don't present as original research

**Verification Steps:**
- [ ] Information is verifiable from other sources
- [ ] Publication is reputable
- [ ] Content is current and accurate
- [ ] Not conflicted (e.g., not another affiliate promoting same brands)

### Tier 4: General Web Sources (Lower Authority)

**What to AVOID:**
- Unknown blogs without expertise
- Social media posts (Twitter, Facebook) as primary source
- Unverified user comments/forum posts (unless aggregated)
- Competitor brand pages (inherently biased)
- Chat forums without expert moderation

**Why Avoid:**
- Unreliable information
- Potential bias/misinformation
- No accountability
- Not verifiable

**Exception - Aggregated Community Opinion:**
- Multiple Reddit threads discussing same experience
- App Store review consensus (multiple similar reviews)
- BBB complaint patterns (if consistent across multiple reports)

### Source Hierarchy in Practice

**Example: Claiming "FanDuel has the best mobile app"**

**Strong Support (Tier 1-2):**
- App Store average rating: 4.8/5 stars (app store = Tier 1)
- 50+ reviews mention smooth interface (aggregated reviews = Tier 1)
- ESPN article: "FanDuel's app experience leads market" (Tier 2)

**Weak Support (Tier 3-4):**
- Generic statement "FanDuel app is great" from affiliate site (Tier 3)
- Single Reddit post saying app is good (Tier 4 alone)

**Correct Approach:**
```
"FanDuel's mobile app consistently ranks highest among bettors,
with an App Store rating of 4.8/5 stars based on [X] reviews.
The interface is intuitive with quick navigation to major sports..."
[Link to App Store page]
```

**Incorrect Approach:**
```
"Everyone says FanDuel has the best app."
[No source, vague claim]
```

### Verification Process for Sources

**For Each Claim Made:**

1. [ ] Identify source tier (1, 2, 3, or 4)
2. [ ] If Tier 3 or 4: Cross-verify with Tier 1 or 2
3. [ ] Include source link for reference
4. [ ] Document date of source
5. [ ] If time-sensitive: Flag for quarterly review
6. [ ] If sourced from Tier 4: Add disclaimer or don't include

**Red Flags for Bad Sources:**
- No author attribution
- No publication date
- Promotional tone (obvious bias)
- Unverifiable claims
- Contradicts multiple other sources
- Author has financial interest not disclosed
