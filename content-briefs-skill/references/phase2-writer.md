## Understanding Parlay Odds

When combining multiple bets into a parlay, the odds multiply rather than add.
A 3-leg parlay at +150, +200, +180 pays much more than three separate bets.

Use our [parlay calculator](https://www.topendsports.com/sport/betting/tools/parlay-calculator.htm)
to see exact payouts for any combination - just enter your odds and stake.

FanDuel's parlay builder makes it easy to construct multi-leg bets...
