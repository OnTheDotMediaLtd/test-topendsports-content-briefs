## Step 1.5: Hub Page Check (CRITICAL)

**Reference:** `references/hub-page-strategy.md`

Before building the outline, check if this is a hub page:

| Page Type | URL Pattern | Special Rules |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Hub Page** | `/[market]/index.htm` | See hub-page-strategy.md |

### If Hub Page:

**Example:**
```

the most competitive NFL odds and comprehensive prop markets, verified through
extensive testing.

betting markets, and withdrawal speeds.
```

## Understanding Parlay Odds

When combining multiple bets into a parlay, the odds multiply rather than add.
A 3-leg parlay at +150, +200, +180 pays much more than three separate bets.

Use our [parlay calculator](https://www.topendsports.com/sport/betting/tools/parlay-calculator.htm)
to see exact payouts for any combination - just enter your odds and stake.

FanDuel's parlay builder makes it easy to construct multi-leg bets...
