## Key Learning: Match or Exceed #1 Ranking Page

The #1 ranking page (sportshandle.com, DR 66) sets the benchmark for content depth. Your brief MUST match or exceed this benchmark.

---

## Research Phase: Competitor Content Analysis

### Step 1: Analyze Top Ranking Page Structure

For the #1 ranking affiliate page, identify:

1. **Number of brands covered** - Match or exceed this number
2. **Sections per brand** - Typically 2-3 sections per brand
3. **Word count estimate** - Calculate approximate word count
4. **H2/H3 patterns** - Extract common content sections
5. **Interactive elements** - Tables, calculators, maps

### Step 2: Calculate Competitive Word Count

```
Competitor Word Count Benchmarks (from SERP analysis):
- sportshandle.com (#1): ~8,000-9,000 words
- legalsportsreport.com: ~9,000+ words
- foxsports.com: ~7,000+ words

MINIMUM TARGET: Match #1 ranking page word count
```
