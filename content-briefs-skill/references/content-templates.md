## Detailed Pros & Cons

### Pros

**1. Unmatched Betting Market Selection** - FanDuel offers over 5,000 daily
betting lines across major and minor sports. You'll find everything from standard
spreads and totals to dozens of player props on every game. No other sportsbook
comes close to this variety.

**2. Industry-Leading Mobile App** - The FanDuel app is faster and more intuitive
than competitors. Live betting updates in under 1 second, and the interface is
optimized for quick bet placement while watching games.

[Continue with additional 3-4 pros...]

### Cons

**1. Higher Minimum Withdrawal** - Unlike many competitors with $5 minimums,
FanDuel requires $10 minimum withdrawals. While not dramatic, this is less
convenient for casual bettors wanting to withdraw small amounts.

**2. Limited Payment Methods** - FanDuel only accepts credit/debit cards and
ACH transfers, while competitors like DraftKings offer PayPal, Venmo, and others.
This limits options for those without bank account access.

## Final Verdict

FanDuel is the best sportsbook in America for bettors who want maximum selection
and a top-notch mobile experience. If you're serious about sports betting, the
market selection alone justifies using FanDuel alongside other books.

The only reason not to use FanDuel is if you prefer simpler betting options or
require specific payment methods not supported. In that case, DraftKings or
BetMGM might be better fits.

If you haven't signed up yet, we recommend starting with FanDuel, claiming the
welcome bonus, and building your account from there.

**Example Tips:**
```
## Pro Tips for Faster Withdrawals

**Tip 1: Use ACH for Speed**
ACH transfers process in 2-3 hours, while debit cards take 3-5 business days.
If you need funds quickly, always choose ACH.

**Tip 2: Withdraw During Business Hours**
Process your withdrawal between 9 AM - 5 PM ET on weekdays. Withdrawals submitted
after hours are queued for next business day processing.

**Tip 3: Verify Your Bank Account First**
If this is your first withdrawal to a new bank account, FanDuel may add a 1-day
verification hold. Add your account 1-2 days before needing the funds.

**Tip 4: Check for Pending Bets**
You can only withdraw settled winnings. If you see "withdraw unavailable" error,
you likely have unsettled bets. Wait for bets to settle.

**Tip 5: Save Your Payment Methods**
After your first withdrawal, FanDuel remembers your bank account. Future
withdrawals take 30 seconds instead of 2-3 minutes.

**Tip 6: Use Multiple Withdrawal Methods**
If ACH fails for any reason (wrong account number, etc.), you can retry with
debit card. Have multiple methods linked.
```

#### Section 5: Troubleshooting (200-300 words)

```
## Troubleshooting & Common Problems

bank account details and resubmit.
