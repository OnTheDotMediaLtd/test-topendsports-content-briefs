## CRITICAL RULES (Always Follow)

### Content Output Rules (From Team Feedback - December 2024)
⚠️ **NEVER shorten, compress, or skip content. Output ALL content in full.**
⚠️ **Do NOT include max-width CSS on elements** - site handles maximum content size
⚠️ **No placeholders** - deliver complete, working code always
⚠️ **Break into multiple artifacts if needed** - but each must be complete
⚠️ **ESPN BET is now theScore BET** (rebranded December 1, 2025)
⚠️ **Use Gold Standard Templates** (see `references/gold-standard-templates.md`)
⚠️ **NEVER use user instructions literally as H2s** - Convert to keyword-optimized headings
⚠️ **NO duplicate content** - If info appears in quick answer box, don't repeat in body
⚠️ **Run self-check rubric before output** (see Pre-Output Verification below)

### Pre-Output Verification Rubric (Self-Check Before EVERY Output)

Before delivering ANY content artifact, verify the following:

**Content Integrity:**
- [ ] All content is complete - nothing shortened or summarized
- [ ] No placeholders - all code is working and complete
- [ ] No duplicate content - quick answer box info not repeated in body paragraphs

**Heading Quality:**
- [ ] All H2/H3 headings use proper keyword-optimized text
- [ ] NO literal user instructions used as headings (e.g., NOT "5 major sportsbooks in the US")
- [ ] Headings follow secondary keyword mapping from Phase 1

**Brand & Data Accuracy:**
- [ ] ESPN BET referenced as theScore BET (if applicable)
- [ ] All bonuses verified from official brand sites
- [ ] State availability data is current

**Format Compliance:**
- [ ] No max-width CSS on any elements
- [ ] Uses Gold Standard Templates for tables/cards
- [ ] Letter badge system for brand logos (no images)

**If ANY check fails, fix before outputting.**

### Mandatory Discovery (Phase 1)
✅ Search "Betting Site Structure" FIRST
✅ Use ACTUAL keyword from structure (not URL)
✅ Identify affiliate competitors (not brand pages)
✅ Call `Ahrefs:doc` before each Ahrefs function
✅ Use verified field names from Reference Library v3.0
✅ **NEW: Complete secondary keyword research (Step 2B)**
   - Identify 8-15 secondary keywords
   - Map each to section (H2/H3/FAQ)
   - Calculate total search volume
✅ Verify bonuses from official brand sites (not affiliate)
✅ Step 1B brand research:
   - REQUIRED: "Best X" comparisons, major brand reviews (top 5 only)
   - OPTIONAL: How-to guides (use defaults: FanDuel #1, BetMGM #2, DraftKings #3)

### Secondary Keyword Optimization (NEW)
✅ ALWAYS research 8-15 secondary keywords
✅ Map high-volume keywords (200+/mo) to H2 titles
✅ Map medium-volume (100-200/mo) to H3 titles
✅ Map question keywords to FAQs
✅ Calculate total search volume for cluster
✅ Include comparison keywords ("[brand] vs [competitor]")
✅ Include feature keywords ("[brand] bonus", "[brand] app")
✅ Include location keywords for state pages

### Competitor Keyword Traffic Analysis (Step 2C - MANDATORY)
✅ After SERP analysis, get top 3 affiliate competitor URLs
✅ For each competitor, run `site-explorer-organic-keywords` (mode: "exact")
✅ Extract keywords with actual traffic (sum_traffic > 0)
✅ Map high-traffic keywords to H2/H3/FAQ headers
✅ Priority: 100+ traffic = H2, 50-100 = H3, 10-50 = FAQ
✅ Every H2/H3 MUST target a specific keyword from this analysis
✅ NEVER use generic headers like "About" or "How to Use"

### Header Optimization Rules (CRITICAL)
✅ Every H2/H3 header MUST target a specific keyword
✅ NEVER use generic headers ("Bonus Details", "Mobile App", "Our Verdict")
✅ Transform generic -> keyword-optimized:
   - "Bonus Details" -> "FanDuel Bonus: Current Welcome Offer" (800/mo)
   - "Mobile App" -> "FanDuel App Review: iOS & Android" (300/mo)
   - "Withdrawals" -> "FanDuel Withdrawal Time: How Fast?" (150/mo)
✅ Use long-tail patterns:
   - [Brand] + [Feature]: "FanDuel Bonus", "DraftKings App"
   - [Brand] + [Question]: "Is FanDuel Legal?", "How to Withdraw from DraftKings"
   - [Brand] vs [Competitor]: "FanDuel vs DraftKings"
   - Best/Top + [Category]: "Best NFL Betting Sites"

### Cannibalization Check (MANDATORY)
✅ Before recommending ANY keyword, check if it exists elsewhere
✅ Search the site structure CSV for the keyword
✅ If found on another page, DO NOT recommend it
✅ Example: "compare betting sites" would cannibalize homepage

### Branded vs Non-Branded Keywords
✅ ALWAYS classify keywords before counting opportunities
✅ BRANDED (low conversion value):
   - Contains sportsbook name: "fanduel kentucky", "draftkings ohio"
   - User already decided on brand
   - Count separately, DO NOT include in "opportunity" counts
✅ NON-BRANDED (high conversion value):
   - Generic terms: "best sports betting apps", "ohio betting promos"
   - User comparing options, researching market
   - THESE are the real opportunities
✅ Report format: "Found 90 keywords: 20 non-branded (focus), 70 branded (defense)"

### Ahrefs API Rules (CRITICAL)
✅ ALWAYS call `Ahrefs:doc` FIRST before any API call
✅ Use EXACT field names from documentation:
   | WRONG | CORRECT |
   |-------|---------|
   | backlinks_links | backlinks |
   | referring_domains | refdomains |
   | search_volume | volume |
   | kw_difficulty | difficulty |
   | ranking | best_position |
   | traffic | sum_traffic |
   | query | keyword |

- ✅ If API call fails, re-check field names against Ahrefs:doc
- ✅ Ahrefs is MANDATORY, not optional

### Output Format Rules
✅ For Excel-ready output, use TSV (tab-separated), NEVER CSV with commas
✅ Commas in URLs break CSV format when pasting
✅ TSV pastes correctly into Excel columns
✅ Provide clear paste instructions to user

### Writer Assignment (Phase 2)
✅ Spanish /es/ = ALWAYS Gustavo Cantella
✅ Check Site Structure first
✅ High-priority = Lewis Humphries
✅ Supporting = Tom Goldsmith

### Intro Format (Phase 2)
✅ 40-50 words before disclosure
✅ 100-150 words total including disclosure
✅ Direct answer in sentence 1
✅ BetInIreland.ie model

### Dating Language (Phase 2 & 3)
✅ NEVER use dates in H1/title (no "October 2025", no "2025")
✅ ALWAYS use "Last Updated" badge after H1
✅ Timeless angles only: "Comprehensive Review", "The #1 Rated App"
✅ Dates OK in: badge, schema dateModified, T&Cs verification

### Source Requirements (Phase 2)
✅ TIER 1 (Primary): Real users (App Store, Google Play, Reddit, Trustpilot)
✅ TIER 2 (Verification): Brand official sites (features, licenses)
✅ TIER 3 (Facts): Industry/regulatory sources
✅ TIER 4 (Sparingly): Affiliate sites for research gaps only
✅ NEVER cite affiliate sites for pros/cons or user experience
✅ All user feedback must have citations: "Mentioned in 847 App Store reviews"

### T&Cs Requirements (Phase 3)
✅ Template 1 (Review): Complete T&Cs REQUIRED (1 brand)
✅ Template 2 (Comparison): Complete T&Cs REQUIRED (ALL brands)
✅ Template 3 (How-To): Brief T&Cs only if bonuses mentioned
✅ Template 4 (State): Complete T&Cs REQUIRED (state-licensed operators)
✅ Use complete HTML template from Verification Standards v3.0
✅ Include: Exact bonus text, all eligibility, all terms, complete legal language
✅ NEVER summarize T&Cs - always copy verbatim from brand sites

### Spanish Content (if /es/ URL)
✅ Writer: Gustavo (no exceptions)
✅ Target: USA Spanish speakers (NOT Spain)
✅ Sportsbooks: FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM (USA operators)
✅ Age: 21+ (NOT 18+)
✅ Hotline: 1-800-522-4700 (USA)
✅ Regulations: USA state-by-state

### Compliance (Phase 3)

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Research Phase (Phase 1)
❌ Assuming keyword from URL → ✅ Get from Site Structure (Column M - Target Keywords)
❌ Reading wrong column (Page Name) → ✅ Always use Column M (Target Keywords)
❌ Analyzing brand pages → ✅ Analyze affiliate competitors
❌ Skipping `Ahrefs:doc` → ✅ Call before each function
❌ Guessing field names → ✅ Use verified field names (volume, not search_volume)
❌ Skipping keyword research entirely → ✅ MANDATORY before competitor analysis
❌ Sampling keywords instead of full analysis → ✅ Process 100% of provided data
❌ Not checking cannibalization → ✅ Check if keyword exists elsewhere first
❌ Counting branded keywords as opportunities → ✅ Separate branded vs non-branded
❌ Verifying bonuses from affiliate sites → ✅ Use brand's official promo page
❌ Wrong writer for Spanish → ✅ Always Gustavo for /es/
❌ Excessive documentation → ✅ Focus on decisions
❌ Moving to Phase 2 automatically → ✅ Stop and wait for user
❌ Including KD/DR scores in output → ✅ Just state opportunity level
❌ Doing Step 1B for simple how-to pages → ✅ Use defaults, save effort
❌ Skipping competitor keyword traffic analysis (Step 2C) → ✅ MANDATORY for all pages
❌ Only researching primary keyword without secondary cluster
❌ Listing secondary keywords without mapping to sections
❌ Not calculating total search volume
❌ Missing high-volume comparison or feature keywords
❌ Generic H2/H3 headers not targeting specific keywords

### Writer Brief Phase (Phase 2)
❌ Using "October 2025" in H1 → ✅ Timeless angle + "Last Updated" badge
❌ Not specifying content type → ✅ Identify Template 1/2/3/4
❌ Allowing generic claims without sources → ✅ Require real user citations
❌ Summarizing T&Cs → ✅ Pass complete legal language from Phase 1
❌ Citing affiliate sites for pros/cons → ✅ Use real users (App Store, Reddit)
❌ **NEW: Generic H2/H3 titles not optimized for keywords**
❌ **NEW: FAQ questions not targeting high-volume search terms**
❌ **NEW: No secondary keyword optimization table**
❌ **NEW: Missing meta keywords list for AI**
❌ **Using user instructions literally as H2s** → ✅ Convert to keyword-optimized headings
   - WRONG: H2 "5 major sportsbooks in the US" (literal user instruction)
   - RIGHT: H2 "Best US Sportsbooks for NFL Betting" (keyword-optimized)

### AI Enhancement Phase (Phase 3)
❌ Forgetting "Last Updated" badge → ✅ Build FIRST, place after H1
❌ Using brief T&Cs instead of complete → ✅ Use full HTML template
❌ T&Cs for only some brands in comparison → ✅ ALL featured brands
❌ Missing state-specific sections → ✅ Add for Template 4
❌ Dated language in meta title → ✅ Check all H1s and meta tags
❌ **NEW: Meta keywords tag missing secondary keywords**
❌ **NEW: FAQ schema questions don't match optimized questions**
❌ **Duplicate content** → ✅ If info in quick answer box, don't repeat in body paragraphs
   - Quick answer box summarizes key info for featured snippet
   - Body content should expand/detail, not repeat same text verbatim

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**If URL not in Site Structure:**
→ Proceed with manual writer assignment
→ Use decision tree from Reference Library v3.0
→ Document reasoning in Brief Control Sheet

**If Ahrefs unavailable:**
→ Note "Ahrefs unavailable - using web research"
→ Use `web_search` for estimates
→ Mark data as estimated
→ Still identify secondary keywords through web research

**If unsure about secondary keywords:**
→ Focus on: comparisons, features, questions, locations
→ Always include "[brand] bonus", "[brand] promo code", "[brand] vs [competitor]"
→ Use Google Keyword Planner or similar if Ahrefs unavailable

**If unsure about Step 1B requirement:**
→ "Best X" comparison pages = REQUIRED
→ Major brand reviews (top 5 brands only) = REQUIRED
→ How-to guides, explainers = OPTIONAL (use defaults)
→ When in doubt = Simplified Step 1B (competitor frequency only)

**If competitor gap unclear:**
→ Default features: Calculator, 7 FAQs, Comparison table
→ These are always improvements

**If unsure about T&Cs requirements:**
→ Check template type in Content Type Templates v3.0
→ Template 1, 2, 4 = Complete T&Cs MANDATORY
→ Template 3 = Only if bonuses mentioned
→ Use complete HTML template from Verification Standards v3.0
