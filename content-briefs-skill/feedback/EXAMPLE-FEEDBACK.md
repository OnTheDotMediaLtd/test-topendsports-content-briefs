## What Worked Well

List 3-5 things that were particularly good:

1. FAQ questions were well-researched and relevant to search intent
2. Brand positioning was clear with specific features for each sportsbook
3. Competitor analysis was thorough - covered all major players
4. Technical specs (schema markup, interactive elements) were detailed
5. Internal linking recommendations were comprehensive

---

## What Needs Improvement

List specific issues found:

1. Word count guidance unclear - "2,500-3,500 words" is too wide a range
2. Missing keyword "nfl player props" (6,500 monthly searches) - competitors all cover this
3. T&Cs section had formatting inconsistencies between brands
4. Some brand features listed without explaining why they matter to bettors
5. Affiliate disclosure template was generic, not customized for NFL content

---

## Keyword Issues

**Cannibalization Concerns**:
- [X] Potential cannibalization with: /sport/betting/nfl/props/player-props.htm

**Missing Keywords**:
- Keyword: nfl player props - Volume: 6,500/month - Why important: ALL 3 competitors rank for this, high-value betting type
- Keyword: nfl teaser bets - Volume: 800/month - Why important: Unique bet type not covered elsewhere

**Unnecessary Keywords**:
- Keyword: nfl fantasy - Why not needed: This is fantasy football, not sports betting (wrong intent)

---

## Writer Experience (for Writers only)

**Time to Complete Article**: 6 hours

**Unclear Instructions**:
1. Word count range too broad - should specify target (e.g., "2,800-3,000 words")
2. FAQ section said "7+ questions" but didn't specify if all need schema markup
3. Not clear if brand T&Cs should be in main content or separate section

**Missing Information Needed**:
1. Had to research BetMGM bonus details myself - brief said "$1,500 welcome bonus" but didn't specify wagering requirements
2. ESPN BET rebranding date mentioned but no guidance on how to handle in article (mention both names? just new name?)

**Sources - Were They Helpful?**:
- [X] Yes, very helpful
- [ ] Somewhat helpful
- [ ] Not helpful - needed to find own sources

Comment: Reddit sources and App Store links were great. Would have liked actual sportsbook T&C URLs.

## Actionable Changes Recommended

2. Check for keyword cannibalization with existing props page before publishing
3. Fix schema markup syntax errors

**Priority 2 (Important)**:
1. Narrow word count guidance to 100-word range (e.g., 2,800-2,900)
2. Include specific bonus T&Cs in brief (wagering requirements, restrictions)
3. Add guidance for ESPN BET rebrand handling

**Priority 3 (Nice to Have)**:
1. Customize affiliate disclosure specifically for NFL content
2. Add visual mockup examples for comparison table
3. Include sportsbook T&C page URLs as sources

## Additional Comments

Overall this was a solid brief. The research was thorough and brand selection was spot-on. Main improvement areas are: (1) checking for keyword conflicts, (2) narrowing word count ranges, and (3) including more specific bonus details.

The multi-agent system did find more keywords than previous briefs I've worked with, but need to be careful about keyword cannibalization. The "nfl player props" keyword is a perfect example - we already have a dedicated page for that, so including it heavily here would cause issues.

Completion time (6 hours) is good but could be reduced to 5 hours with tighter word count guidance and more specific bonus T&C details upfront.
