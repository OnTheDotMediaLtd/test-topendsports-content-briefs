# Sample Markdown Document

This is a sample markdown file for testing the conversion to DOCX format.

## Introduction

This document contains various markdown elements to test the parser:

- Headings at multiple levels
- Lists (bullet and numbered)
- Code blocks
- Tables
- Inline formatting

## Headings Example

### Level 3 Heading

This is content under a level 3 heading.

#### Level 4 Heading

And this is level 4.

##### Level 5 Heading

Finally, level 5.

## Lists

### Bullet Lists

- First bullet point
- Second bullet point with **bold text**
- Third bullet point with `inline code`
- Fourth bullet point

### Numbered Lists

1. First numbered item
2. Second numbered item
3. Third numbered item
4. Fourth numbered item

## Code Blocks

Here's a Python code example:

```python
def hello_world():
    """Print hello world."""
    print("Hello, World!")
    return True
```

And a JavaScript example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

## Tables

| Feature | Support | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Headings | Yes | H1-H5 supported |
| Lists | Yes | Both bullet and numbered |
| Code | Yes | Inline and blocks |
| Tables | Yes | Basic markdown tables |

## Inline Formatting

This paragraph has **bold text**, `inline code`, and more **bold formatting**.

You can also have text with multiple formatting elements combined.

## Blockquotes

> And is useful for highlighting important information.

## Additional Content

### Special Characters

Testing special characters: & < > " '

### Empty Sections

Sometimes sections might be empty:
