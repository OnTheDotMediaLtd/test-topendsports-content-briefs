## The Data

| State | Bonuses Volume | Promo Codes Volume | URL Overlap | Same Intent? |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Colorado** | 250 | 150 | 30% exact, 60% domain | ✅ YES |
| **Ohio** | 200 | 200 | 30% exact, 60% domain | ✅ YES |
| **New York** | 80 | 150 | (similar pattern) | ✅ YES |

---

## What Google Thinks

### Same Intent Signals ✅
- Nearly identical keyword difficulty (within 5-10 points)
- 30-40% of top 10 results are EXACT same URLs
- 60-70% domain overlap (same sites ranking)
- Similar CPC ($2-9 range, within 10%)
- Same traffic potential estimates

### Different Intent Signals ❌
- Different SERP features: **NO** ❌
- Different ranking pages: **ONLY 30-40%** ❌
- Different user goals: **NO** ❌
- Different content types: **NO** ❌

**VERDICT: Google treats them as synonyms/variations, NOT different intents**

## What Competitors Do

**Strategy used by TOP ranking sites:**

| Site | Pages | URL Pattern |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Covers | ✅ ONE | `/bonuses/[state]-best-bonuses-promo-codes` |
| SportsbookReview | ✅ ONE | `/bonuses-[state]/` |
| Sportsline | ✅ ONE | `/sportsbooks/promos/` |
| Sportshandle | ✅ ONE | `/[state]/` |
| BetColorado/BetOhio | ✅ ONE | `/promos` |

**Sites using separate pages:** ZERO

---

## What Ranking Content Shows

**80-90% of ranking pages explicitly include BOTH terms in:**
- Title tags: "Colorado Sportsbook Promos, Bonuses & Codes"
- URLs: `/bonuses-promo-codes/` or `/bonuses-[state]/`
- H1 headings: "Best [State] Bonuses & Promo Codes"

**This proves:** Sites intentionally target BOTH keywords on ONE page to maximize relevance.

## Risks Comparison

### Risk of ONE Combined Page: LOW ✅

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Miss extra traffic | LOW | Low | Same users searching both terms |
| Don't rank for variant | LOW | Medium | Competitors rank for both on one page |
| Content too generic | LOW | Low | Create specific sections for codes |

**TOTAL RISK: LOW** ✅

### Risk of TWO Separate Pages: HIGH ❌

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Keyword cannibalization | **HIGH** | **HIGH** | Would need to de-optimize one page |
| Duplicate content | **HIGH** | **HIGH** | Impossible to avoid 90%+ overlap |
| Split authority | **CERTAIN** | **HIGH** | Backlinks divided = weaker rankings |
| Maintenance burden | **CERTAIN** | Medium | 2x effort for updates |
| Against best practices | **CERTAIN** | High | Zero competitors do this |

**TOTAL RISK: HIGH** ❌

## Recommended Strategy

### URL Pattern
```
/betting/[state]-sportsbook-bonuses/
```

**Example:**
- `/betting/colorado-sportsbook-bonuses/`
- `/betting/ohio-sportsbook-bonuses/`
- `/betting/new-york-sportsbook-bonuses/`

### Target Keywords (Both on ONE page)
- Primary: `[state] sportsbook bonuses`
- Secondary: `[state] sportsbook promo codes`
- Related: `[state] betting bonuses`, `[state] welcome bonuses`

### On-Page Optimization

**Title Tag:**
```
Best [State] Sportsbook Bonuses & Promo Codes [Year] | TopEndSports
```

**H1:**
```
[State] Sportsbook Bonuses & Promo Codes
```

**H2 Structure:**
- Top [State] Sportsbook Bonuses
- Promo Code Requirements by Sportsbook ← Addresses "promo codes" intent
- [State] Welcome Bonus Comparison
- Which [State] Sportsbooks Require Promo Codes? ← Specific to codes
- How to Claim [State] Sportsbook Bonuses
- [State] Bonus Terms & Conditions

**Content Distribution:**
- Use "bonuses" 8-12 times
- Use "promo codes" 6-10 times
- Use "promos" 4-6 times (synonym)
- Mix naturally throughout

### Specific Section for Promo Codes

Include dedicated 150-200 word section:

**H2: "Which [State] Sportsbooks Require Promo Codes?"**

> Not all sportsbook bonuses require a promo code to claim. In [State], most major operators like FanDuel and DraftKings automatically apply bonuses when you sign up, while others like BetMGM and Caesars require you to enter a specific promo code during registration.
>
> **No Code Required:**
> - FanDuel
> - DraftKings
> - Fanatics
>
> **Code Required:**
> - BetMGM (use: COVERS1500)
> - Caesars (use: SBR20X)
> - bet365 (use: SBRBONUS)

This section directly addresses users searching "promo codes" specifically.

## FAQs for Content Team

**Q: Won't we lose traffic by not having two pages?**
A: No. The same users search both terms. 30-40% of results are the same URLs, proving Google serves similar results for both queries.

**Q: But "promo codes" has 150 volume in NY, shouldn't we target it separately?**
A: One page can rank for both. Covers.com ranks #2-3 for BOTH queries with ONE page.

**Q: What if one keyword ranks poorly?**
A: Increase density of underperforming term. Competitors rank well for both on one page, so it's achievable.

**Q: Should we redirect `/promo-codes/` URLs?**
A: Only if you already created them. Otherwise, don't create alternate URLs at all.

**Q: How do we avoid the page feeling generic?**
A: Create specific sections addressing code requirements (see template above).
