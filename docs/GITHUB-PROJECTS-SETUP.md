GitHub Projects is a project management tool (like Trello or Asana) built into GitHub. Here's how to set it up for tracking content briefs.

---

## Step 1: Create a New Project

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/OnTheDotMediaLtd/topendsports-content-briefs
2. Click the **"Projects"** tab
3. Click **"New project"** (green button)
4. Choose **"Board"** view (looks like Trello)
5. Name it: **"Content Briefs Pipeline"**
6. Click **"Create project"**

## Step 2: Set Up Columns

Create these columns by clicking **"+ Add column"**:

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Backlog** | Pages that need briefs created |
| **Phase 1 - Research** | Currently doing keyword research |
| **Phase 2 - Writer Brief** | Creating the writer brief |
| **Phase 3 - Technical** | Creating AI enhancement brief |
| **Review** | Brief complete, awaiting review |
| **Done** | Brief approved and delivered |

---

## Step 3: Add Cards for Each Brief

For each page that needs a brief:

1. Click **"+ Add item"** in the Backlog column
2. Enter the page name (e.g., "Best NFL Betting Sites")
3. Press Enter
4. Click on the card to add details:
   - **Assignee:** Who's working on it
   - **Priority:** Critical/High/Medium/Low
   - **Labels:** Add labels like "Lewis", "Tom", "Spanish"

---

## Step 4: Link to Issues (Optional but Recommended)

You can convert cards to Issues for better tracking:

1. Click on a card
2. Click **"Convert to issue"**
3. This creates a trackable issue that can have:
   - Comments and discussion
   - Attachments
   - Due dates
   - Sub-tasks (as checkboxes)
