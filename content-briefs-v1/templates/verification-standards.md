## Bonus Verification Protocol

### Critical Rule
**Always verify from brand's official promo page. Never trust third-party sites.**

### Official Promo Pages
- FanDuel: `sportsbook.fanduel.com/promos`
- DraftKings: `sportsbook.draftkings.com/promos`
- BetMGM: `sports.betmgm.com/promotions`
- Caesars: `caesars.com/sportsbook-and-casino/promotions`
- theScore BET: `thescore.bet/promotions` (formerly ESPN BET - rebranded Dec 2025)

### 5-Step Process

1. **Find Official Page** - Go to brand's promo page
2. **Copy Exact Text** - Headline + visible fine print + legal
3. **Copy Complete T&Cs** - Eligibility, conditions, terms, restrictions
4. **Document Verification** - Source URL, date, next due date
5. **Re-Verify Schedule** - Monthly minimum, bi-weekly for high traffic

### State-Specific Verification
Some bonuses vary by state. Check for "Offer may vary by state" and verify each state's specific page.

## Source Hierarchy

### Tier 1: Direct User Feedback (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**App Store (iOS)**
- Format: "4.9/5 (1.8M reviews) - analyzed Oct 1-14, 2025"
- Citation: "Mentioned in 847 App Store reviews as '[specific praise]'"

**Google Play (Android)**
- Format: "4.7/5 (371.9K reviews) - analyzed Sept-Oct 2025"
- Citation: "Reported in 402 Google Play reviews"

**Reddit r/sportsbook**
- Format: "Reddit users report [finding] (15 threads analyzed)"
- Search: `site:reddit.com/r/sportsbook [brand name]`
- Prioritize posts with 20+ upvotes

**Trustpilot**
- Verified customer reviews
- Overall score + verified complaints

### Tier 2: Brand Official (Verification Only)
- Feature verification only
- Announcements and issue acknowledgments
- ❌ NOT for user experience claims

### Tier 3: Industry/Regulatory (Facts Only)
- State Gaming Commissions: Legal status, licenses
- Industry Publications: Market data, revenue

### Tier 4: Affiliate Sites (Use Sparingly)
- ⚠️ Research gaps only
- ❌ NEVER cite for pros/cons or user experience

### Citation Format Example
```
"FanDuel's mobile app receives consistent praise from users, with 847 App 
Store reviewers specifically mentioning 'best app interface' in reviews 
from the last 30 days (4.9/5 rating across 1.8M total reviews, analyzed 
Oct 1-14, 2025)."
```

### USE Instead

### WHERE Dates ARE Appropriate

- ✅ User feedback: "Reviews analyzed Oct 1-14, 2025"
- ✅ Within content: "As of October 2025..."

## Quality Spot-Check Questions

Before final delivery, ask:

1. **Would this be accurate in 6 months without "Last Updated" date?**
   → If no → Remove dated language from body

2. **If user visits brand site now, will they see same bonus?**
   → If unsure → Re-verify before publishing

3. **Are pros/cons based on real users or affiliate sites?**
   → If affiliate → Find real user sources

4. **Would brand representative agree T&Cs are accurate?**
   → If no → Get exact language from official source

5. **Can I defend every claim with documented source?**
   → If no → Add source or remove claim
