# Internal Linking Strategy Skill

## Description
Strategic skill for adding high-value internal links using ONLY verified URLs from the approved list. Maximizes page authority distribution while preventing 404 errors and maintaining natural content flow.

## When to Use This Skill
- After content optimization is complete
- When adding contextual links between sections
- During content gap analysis
- When reviewing link distribution across site
- Before final delivery of optimized pages

## Core Linking Philosophy

**VERIFIED URLs ONLY - If it's not on the list, ASK FIRST.**

Using non-existent URLs creates 404 errors and damages user experience. Every internal link must come from the verified URLs list.

## Link Placement Strategy

### Maximum Links Per Page

**NEVER exceed these limits:**
- Maximum 3-4 instances of the same internal link per page
- Affiliate links can appear 3-4 times each
- Spread links throughout content, not clustered

### Spacing Rules

**CRITICAL:**
- No duplicate links within 200 words of each other
- Distribute links across multiple sections
- Vary placement (beginning, middle, end of sections)

### Natural Integration

**Add links in transition sentences, not forced into existing text:**

**GOOD:**
```
Original: "Understanding odds is crucial for betting success."
Optimized: "Understanding odds is crucial for betting success. Our betting odds calculator can help you compare different bet types and find value."
```

**BAD:**
```
Original: "Understanding odds is crucial for betting success."
Forced: "Understanding odds is crucial for betting success with our betting odds calculator."
```

## Anchor Text Variation

**THE RULE: Never use the same anchor text repeatedly**

### For compare-sportsbooks.htm:

**VARY:**
- "compare sportsbooks"
- "sportsbook comparison"
- "compare betting sites"
- "see how they stack up"

**DON'T:**
- "compare sportsbooks" (used 4 times)

### For best-apps.htm:

**VARY:**
- "best betting apps"
- "top sports betting apps"
- "mobile betting apps"
- "betting app reviews"

**DON'T:**
- "best betting apps" (used 4 times)

### For sportsbook reviews:

**VARY:**
- "FanDuel review"
- "FanDuel sportsbook review"
- "our detailed FanDuel analysis"
- "read our FanDuel breakdown"

**DON'T:**
- "FanDuel review" (used 4 times)

## Link Validation Rules

### Before Adding ANY Link:

1. **Check verified URLs list**
   - Is this URL in Section 5 of CLAUDE.md?
   - If NO → DO NOT add link, ask user first

2. **Check link count**
   - How many times have I linked to this URL on this page?
   - If ≥ 4 → DO NOT add another link

3. **Check spacing**
   - Is there another link within 200 words?
   - If YES → Move to different section

4. **Check anchor text**
   - Have I used this exact anchor text before on this page?
   - If YES → Use variation instead

## Contextual Link Addition

### Method 1: Transition Sentences

**Add NEW sentences that bridge to related content:**

```
Section about point spreads ends...

[ADD THIS]: "For more advanced betting strategies, explore our NBA betting guide for sport-specific insights."
```

### Method 2: Parenthetical Links

**Add contextual references in parentheses:**

```
"Mobile betting has grown rapidly in recent years (see our best betting apps for the latest options)."
```

### Method 3: Definition/Expansion

**Expand existing mentions with links:**

```
Original: "Many bettors prefer parlay bets."
Expanded: "Many bettors prefer parlay bets—check our best parlay betting sites to find the top options."
```

### Method 4: List Enhancement

**Add linked items to existing lists:**

```
Original:
- Check team stats
- Review injury reports
- Compare odds

Enhanced:
- Check team stats
- Review injury reports
- Compare odds (use our compare sportsbooks tool)
- Explore prop bets (see best prop betting sites)
```

## Priority Linking Hierarchy

**Link to high-value pages first:**

### Tier 1 (Highest Priority):
- Main betting hub (/sport/betting/index.htm)
- Sportsbook reviews (FanDuel, BetMGM, DraftKings, Caesars)
- Promo code pages (FanDuel, BetMGM, DraftKings)

### Tier 2 (High Priority):
- Category pages (best-apps, best-bonuses, compare-sportsbooks)
- Sport-specific betting guides (MLB, NBA, NFL, soccer)

### Tier 3 (Supporting Priority):
- Specialized guides (prop betting, live betting, parlays, SGP)
- Payment method pages (PayPal, crypto)
- Calculation tools

**Strategy:** If you can only add 3-4 links, prioritize Tier 1 pages.

## Link Density Targets

**General Guidelines:**
- 1-2 internal links per 500 words
- Maximum 3-5 internal links per 1,000 words
- Spread evenly throughout content
- No clustering in one section

**Example for 1,500-word article:**
- Target: 4-6 internal links total
- Distribution: 1-2 in intro, 2-3 in body sections, 1-2 in conclusion

## Keyword-Rich Anchor Text

**Make anchor text descriptive and keyword-rich:**

### GOOD:
- "best betting apps for iOS and Android"
- "FanDuel sportsbook review and bonus analysis"
- "compare sportsbooks and find the best odds"

### BAD (Generic):
- "click here"
- "read more"
- "this page"
- "see here"

### BAD (Keyword Stuffing):
- "best betting apps best betting apps best betting"
- "FanDuel FanDuel review FanDuel sportsbook"

## Validation Checklist

### Before Delivery:

- [ ] Every internal link uses a URL from verified list (Section 5)
- [ ] No invented or guessed URLs
- [ ] Maximum 3-4 instances of same internal link
- [ ] No duplicate links within 200 words of each other
- [ ] Anchor text varies for same destination
- [ ] Links distributed across multiple sections (not clustered)
- [ ] All links add value (contextually relevant)
- [ ] No generic "click here" or "read more" anchors
- [ ] If URL needed but not on list, flagged for review

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Using Non-Verified URLs
```
WRONG: Adding link to /sport/betting/parlays-explained.htm (not on verified list)

RIGHT: Use /sport/betting/best-parlay-betting-sites-and-apps.htm (verified)
```

### Mistake 2: Clustering Links
```
WRONG:
"Check our best betting apps, compare sportsbooks, and see promo codes for the top sites."
(3 links in one sentence)

RIGHT:
Distribute these links across 3 different sections
```

### Mistake 3: Repeating Anchor Text
```
WRONG:
- Paragraph 2: "best betting apps"
- Paragraph 5: "best betting apps"
- Paragraph 8: "best betting apps"

RIGHT:
- Paragraph 2: "best betting apps"
- Paragraph 5: "top sports betting apps"
- Paragraph 8: "mobile betting apps"
```

### Mistake 4: Generic Anchors
```
WRONG:
"For more information, click here."

RIGHT:
"For a detailed comparison, see our sportsbook comparison guide."
```

## Link Attribution for Affiliates

**When linking to affiliate partners (FanDuel, BetMGM, etc.):**

### Required Attributes:
```html
<a href="[URL]" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">Anchor Text</a>
```

### Responsible Gambling Disclaimer:

**Include with every CTA block that contains affiliate links:**
```
21+ only. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER.
```
