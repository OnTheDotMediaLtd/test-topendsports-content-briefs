- Before rewriting headings or paragraphs
- When adding internal links to expert sections
- During SEO optimization of existing content
- When reviewing optimized content for delivery

## Core Preservation Philosophy

**PRESERVE the soul, OPTIMIZE the surface.**

Rob Wood's expert content is the competitive advantage. Competitors can copy structure, but they cannot replicate genuine expertise built over 25+ years.

### THE GOLDEN RULE

- ADD to content, don't REPLACE it
- ENHANCE structure, don't REWRITE substance
- OPTIMIZE headings, but PRESERVE paragraphs

## What CAN Be Optimized

### 1. Headings (H1, H2, H3)

**ALLOWED:**
- Reword to include target keywords
- Keep the meaning and topic intact
- Make more scannable

**Example:**
```
Original: "Understanding Spreads"
Optimized: "Point Spread Betting Explained"
```

**Why This Works:**
- Same topic, better keywords
- More descriptive for users
- Maintains intent

### 2. Opening Sentences of Paragraphs

**ALLOWED:**
- Insert target keyword naturally in first sentence
- Don't change the rest of the paragraph

**Example:**
```
Original: "The favorite must win by more than the spread."

Optimized: "When betting on point spreads, the favorite must win by more than the spread."
```

**Why This Works:**
- Added keyword context
- Rest of paragraph unchanged
- Expert content preserved

### 3. Transition Sentences

**ALLOWED:**
- Add internal links contextually between sections
- Add bridge sentences that link to related pages

**Example:**
```
Original: [End of section about spreads]

Optimized: [End of section about spreads]
"For more advanced betting strategies, see our complete guide to prop betting."
```

**Why This Works:**
- New sentence, not replacing existing
- Provides value to user
- Doesn't alter expert content

### 4. Lists and Bullet Points

**ALLOWED:**
- Expand for clarity
- Restructure for better scanability
- Add keyword variations to list items

**Example:**
```
Original:
- Check team stats
- Review injury reports
- Compare odds

Optimized:
- **Check team statistics**: Recent performance, head-to-head records
- **Review injury reports**: Key player availability impacts betting lines
- **Compare odds across sportsbooks**: Find the best value for your bet
```

**Why This Works:**
- Added context and keywords
- Made more actionable
- Original items preserved

### 5. New Content Sections

**ALLOWED:**
- Add sections that are MISSING (content gaps from research)
- Add new FAQ questions
- Add new comparison tables
- Add Quick Answer boxes
- Add interactive elements

**CRITICAL:** DO NOT replace existing sections with new content

### 6. Meta Elements

**ALLOWED:**
- Title tag (optimize for CTR + keywords)
- Meta description (optimize for CTR)
- Schema markup (add/enhance)

## What MUST Be Preserved Verbatim

### 1. Rob Wood's Expert Analysis

**NEVER CHANGE:**
- Any paragraph explaining WHY something works
- Exercise science explanations
- Athletic performance insights
- Research-based methodology

**Example of Protected Content:**
```
"From a biomechanics perspective, the vertical jump test measures
the power output of the leg muscles during explosive movements.
Research shows that athletes with higher vertical jumps typically
demonstrate superior fast-twitch muscle fiber composition..."
```

**Why This Is Protected:**
- Unique expert knowledge
- Scientific credibility
- Cannot be replicated by competitors
- E-E-A-T signal

### 2. "Athletic Edge" Paragraphs

**NEVER CHANGE:**
- Sections titled or containing "Athletic edge:"
- Unique expertise that competitors cannot replicate
- Performance analysis content

**Example:**
```
Athletic edge: Understanding the relationship between VO2 max
and endurance performance allows coaches to design more effective
training programs...
```

### 3. Research Citations and Data

**NEVER CHANGE:**
- Scientific credibility markers
- Data points and statistics from research
- Source attributions

**Example:**
```
"According to a 2018 study published in the Journal of Sports
Sciences (Smith et al.), athletes who..."
```

### 4. Author Voice and Tone

**NEVER CHANGE:**
- The authoritative, educational tone
- Technical terminology (don't "dumb down")
- First-hand experience indicators

**Why:**
- Don't make expert content sound generic/AI-written
- Preserve the unique voice that establishes authority

### 5. Unique Angles and Perspectives

**NEVER CHANGE:**
- Content that provides genuine E-E-A-T signals
- First-hand experience indicators
- Unique methodologies or frameworks

## The Preservation Rule

**If Rob Wood wrote a paragraph explaining WHY something works based on exercise science or athletic performance data → KEEP IT VERBATIM.**

### YOU MAY:
- Add a keyword to the first sentence
- Add an internal link where contextually relevant
- Bold a key term (first instance only)
- Add a follow-up sentence that links to a related page

### YOU MAY NOT:
- Rewrite the paragraph in "SEO-friendly" language
- Remove sentences to make it "more concise"
- Replace expert terminology with simpler words
- Delete content because "competitors don't have it"
- Merge or condense expert sections

## Natural Writing Guidelines

To avoid making content sound AI-generated while optimizing:

### DO:
- Vary sentence length (short, medium, long mixed)
- Use contractions naturally (don't, won't, it's)
- Include occasional questions to engage reader
- Use specific examples and numbers, not generic statements
- Write in active voice primarily
- Preserve the author's natural writing patterns

### DON'T:
- Start multiple consecutive sentences with the same word
- Use excessive transition phrases ("Moreover, furthermore, additionally...")
- Create formulaic headings ("Understanding X: A Complete Guide to Y")
- Add repetitive sentence structures
- Over-structure with bullet lists after every paragraph

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Over-Optimizing Expert Content
```
WRONG:
Original: "VO2 max represents the maximum rate of oxygen consumption during exercise."
Changed to: "When measuring VO2 max for athletes, it represents the maximum rate of oxygen consumption during maximal exercise performance."

RIGHT:
Keep original, maybe add keyword to heading instead.
```

**Why Wrong:** Added unnecessary words, made it sound unnatural

### Mistake 2: Simplifying Technical Terms
```
WRONG:
Original: "proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation"
Changed to: "muscle stretching technique"

RIGHT:
Keep "proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation" - it's expert terminology
```

**Why Wrong:** Dumbed down the content, reduced credibility

### Mistake 3: Removing Research Citations
```
WRONG:
Original: "According to research by Cooper (1968)..."
Changed to: "Research shows..."

RIGHT:
Keep the specific citation
```

**Why Wrong:** Lost credibility and verifiability

### Mistake 4: Rewriting Unique Perspectives
```
WRONG:
Original: "In my 25 years of working with elite athletes..."
Changed to: "Expert research indicates..."

RIGHT:
Preserve the first-person expertise
```

**Why Wrong:** Lost the E-E-A-T signal of first-hand experience

## Testing for Content Preservation

### Quick Test Questions:

1. **Would a subject matter expert recognize this as the same content?**
   - If no → You've over-optimized

2. **Can you still identify the author's voice?**
   - If no → You've made it too generic

3. **Are scientific terms and citations intact?**
   - If no → You've lost credibility signals

4. **Would this pass as unique expert content?**
   - If no → You've made it sound like everyone else

5. **Could a competitor write this same content?**
   - If yes → You've lost the competitive advantage

## Success Criteria

Content preservation is successful when:

1. All expert analysis paragraphs remain verbatim
2. Research citations and data intact
3. Author voice recognizable throughout
4. Technical terminology preserved
5. Unique perspectives and methodologies unchanged
6. New optimizations ADD value without REPLACING expertise
7. Content still reads naturally, not AI-generated
8. E-E-A-T signals strengthened, not diluted
