# SEO Keyword Integration Skill

## Description
Strategic skill for integrating keywords naturally into content without triggering AI detection patterns or keyword stuffing penalties. Focuses on maintaining natural readability while optimizing for search engines and LLMs.

## When to Use This Skill
- After completing GSC and Ahrefs keyword research
- Before optimizing headings and content
- When adding keywords to existing pages
- During content gap filling
- When reviewing content for natural language flow

## Core Integration Philosophy

**Natural placement > Keyword density**

Keywords should enhance readability, not disrupt it. If adding a keyword makes content sound unnatural, don't force it.

## Keyword Research Sources

### 1. Google Search Console (GSC) Data

**What to Look For:**
- High impressions + Low clicks = CTR problem (optimize title/meta)
- Position 5-15 with decent volume = Push-up opportunity
- Position 10-20 = Add keyword to H1, H2s, intro
- Queries you don't target = Content gaps

**Priority Keywords:**
1. High impressions + Position 5-15 = BEST opportunities
2. High impressions + 0 clicks = Title/meta crisis
3. Position 11-20 with volume = Quick wins

### 2. Ahrefs Keyword Research

**Required Queries:**
- `site-explorer-organic-keywords` - Current page performance
- `keywords-explorer-overview` - Primary keyword metrics
- `keywords-explorer-matching-terms` - Long-tail variations
- `keywords-explorer-related-terms` - "also rank for" keywords
- `serp-overview` - Competitor analysis

**Cross-Reference:**
- GSC shows what Google SHOWS the page for (actual impressions)
- Ahrefs shows what the page COULD rank for (market potential)
- Overlap = Validate and prioritize
- Ahrefs-only = Content gaps to fill
- GSC-only = Quick wins (already indexed)

## Keyword Placement Strategy

### Primary Keyword (1 keyword)

**MUST appear in:**
- [ ] H1 (exactly once)
- [ ] First paragraph (first 100 words)
- [ ] 2-3 H2 headings
- [ ] Conclusion paragraph
- [ ] Title tag (near beginning)
- [ ] Meta description
- [ ] URL slug (if possible)

**Example:**
```
Primary: "point spread betting"

H1: How Point Spread Betting Works
First paragraph: "Point spread betting is one of the most popular..."
H2: Point Spread Betting Strategies
H2: Common Point Spread Mistakes
Conclusion: "Mastering point spread betting requires..."
```

### Secondary Keywords (8-15 keywords)

**Distribute across:**
- [ ] H2 headings
- [ ] H3 subheadings
- [ ] Body paragraphs (natural mentions)
- [ ] FAQ questions
- [ ] Image alt text
- [ ] Internal link anchor text

**Example:**
```
Secondary: "betting against the spread", "ATS records", "cover the spread"

H2: Betting Against the Spread Explained
H3: How to Read ATS Records
Body: "When a team covers the spread..."
FAQ: "What does ATS mean in betting?"
```

### Long-Tail Keywords (20-30 keywords)

**Use in:**
- [ ] H3 subheadings
- [ ] FAQ questions
- [ ] Definition boxes
- [ ] List items
- [ ] Natural paragraph mentions

**Example:**
```
Long-tail: "how does point spread work in basketball", "what happens if point spread is exact"

FAQ: "How does point spread work in basketball?"
FAQ: "What happens if the point spread is exact?"
```

### Related Terms (15-25 terms)

**Sprinkle throughout:**
- [ ] Body content (natural mentions)
- [ ] Key takeaway boxes
- [ ] Expert quotes
- [ ] Pro tips
- [ ] Comparison tables

**Example:**
```
Related: "moneyline", "over/under", "parlay", "handicap"

Body: "Unlike moneyline bets where you simply pick the winner..."
```

## Avoiding AI-Generated Content Patterns

### Pattern 1: HEAVY COLON USAGE

**AVOID:**
```
"NBA Betting: Understanding the Spread: A Complete Guide"
"Key Insight: When betting on favorites: Consider the spread carefully"
```

**BETTER:**
```
"How to Understand NBA Point Spreads"
"When betting on favorites, consider the spread carefully"
```

**Rule:** Maximum 1-2 colons per section

### Pattern 2: REPETITIVE SENTENCE STRUCTURES

**AVOID:**
```
"This is important. This is crucial. This is essential."
"First, you should... Second, you should... Third, you should..."
```

**BETTER:**
```
"Understanding this concept is crucial for betting success."
"Start by analyzing team stats, then review injury reports, and finally compare odds."
```

**Rule:** Vary sentence length and structure

### Pattern 3: EXCESSIVE TRANSITION PHRASES

**AVOID:**
```
"Moreover, furthermore, additionally, in addition to this..."
```

**BETTER:**
```
Use transitions sparingly and vary them naturally
```

**Rule:** Maximum 1-2 formal transitions per section

### Pattern 4: FORMULAIC HEADINGS

**AVOID:**
```
"Understanding X: A Complete Guide to Y"
"Everything You Need to Know About X"
"X: Tips, Tricks, and Strategies"
```

**BETTER:**
```
"How X Works"
"Why X Matters for Betting"
"X Explained"
```

**Rule:** Simple, natural headings

### Pattern 5: KEYWORD STUFFING

**AVOID:**
```
"NBA betting strategies for NBA betting success in NBA betting require understanding NBA betting odds."
```

**BETTER:**
```
"Successful NBA betting requires understanding odds, analyzing team performance, and managing your bankroll wisely."
```

**Rule:** If it sounds unnatural, rewrite with synonyms

## Title Tag Optimization

### Formula
`[Primary Keyword] - [Value Proposition] (Year)`

### Requirements
- [ ] Under 60 characters
- [ ] Primary keyword near beginning
- [ ] Include year (2025) for freshness
- [ ] Use power words (Complete, Guide, Explained, Best)
- [ ] AVOID heavy colon usage (max 1)
- [ ] NO formulaic patterns

**Examples:**

**GOOD:**
```
"NBA Betting Strategy Guide - 10 Expert Tips (2025)"
"Point Spread Betting Explained (2025)"
"Best Sports Betting Sites - Top 10 Reviewed (2025)"
```

**BAD:**
```
"NBA Betting: Complete Strategy Guide: Tips and Tricks: 2025 Edition"
"Understanding Point Spread Betting: A Complete Guide"
"Best Sports Betting Sites: Top Sportsbooks: 2025 Reviews"
```

## Meta Description Optimization

### Requirements
- [ ] Under 155 characters
- [ ] Include primary keyword
- [ ] Include call-to-action
- [ ] Convey unique value proposition
- [ ] Write naturally (not keyword-stuffed)

**Examples:**

**GOOD:**
```
"Learn proven NBA betting strategies from expert analysis. Discover how to read odds, manage bankroll, and win more bets in 2025."
```

**BAD:**
```
"NBA betting NBA strategies NBA tips NBA guide NBA betting strategies NBA betting tips NBA betting guide NBA betting 2025"
```

## Heading Optimization Guidelines

### H1 (One per page)
- Include primary keyword
- Make it compelling and clear
- No colons unless absolutely necessary
- Match search intent

**Example:**
```
Primary: "sports betting strategy"

GOOD: "Sports Betting Strategy Guide for Beginners"
BAD: "Sports Betting: Strategy Guide: Tips and Tricks"
```

### H2 (Section headings)
- Include secondary keywords and variations
- Every 200-300 words
- Scannable and descriptive

**Example:**
```
Secondary: "bankroll management", "betting odds explained"

H2: Bankroll Management for Long-Term Success
H2: How Betting Odds Work
```

### H3 (Subsection headings)
- Include long-tail keywords
- Answer specific questions
- More detailed than H2

**Example:**
```
Long-tail: "how much to bet per game", "what do plus and minus odds mean"

H3: How Much Should You Bet Per Game?
H3: What Do Plus and Minus Odds Mean?
```

## Keyword Density Targets

**DO NOT obsess over exact percentages. Focus on natural usage.**

### General Guidelines:
- Primary keyword: 1-2% of total words (0.5-1% is often enough)
- Secondary keywords: 0.5-1% each
- Long-tail keywords: Natural mentions (don't force)
- Related terms: Sprinkle throughout naturally

### Quality Check:
Read content aloud. If a keyword sounds forced or unnatural, remove it or rephrase.

## FAQ Optimization

**FAQs are keyword gold mines for long-tail terms.**

### Strategy:
1. Use exact question phrases from keyword research
2. Include primary/secondary keywords in answers
3. Keep answers concise (50-150 words)
4. Add FAQPage schema markup

**Example:**
```
Keyword research shows: "how does point spread work"

FAQ:
Q: How does point spread work in betting?
A: Point spread betting requires the favorite to win by more than a set margin (the spread) for your bet to pay out. If you bet on the underdog, they can lose by less than the spread or win outright for you to win the bet.
```

## Internal Link Anchor Text

**Use keyword variations in anchor text, but vary them.**

### Strategy:
- Don't use exact match repeatedly
- Use synonyms and variations
- Make anchor text descriptive
- Maximum 3-4 links per page to same destination

**Example:**
```
Target page: /best-betting-apps.htm

VARY THE ANCHORS:
- "best betting apps"
- "top sports betting apps"
- "mobile betting apps"
- "betting app reviews"

DON'T REPEAT:
- "best betting apps"
- "best betting apps"
- "best betting apps"
```
